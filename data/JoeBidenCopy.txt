Representatives of the people took a vote on the floor of the United States Congress to say loudly and clearly:

Love is love. 
Right is right.
Justice is justice.
Thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, out-of-pocket expenses for prescription drug prices will be capped at no more than $2,000 a year for Medicare recipients.
When hospitals and community centers are threatened and intimidated because they support LGBTQI+ children and families, we have to speak out. We must stop hate and violence.
The American people won.
Big Pharma lost.

Medicare will have the power to negotiate for lower prescription drug prices.
We are making the largest investment ever in combating the climate crisis through the Inflation Reduction Act.
We’re building an economy from the bottom up and the middle out. 

An economy with good jobs and good wages for the long run.
I had some MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENTS the last couple of weeks, too…

✔️ Inflation’s easing
✔️ I just signed the Respect for Marriage Act
✔️ We brought Brittney Griner home
✔️ Gas prices are lower than a year ago
✔️ 10,000 new high-paying jobs in Arizona
The Respect for Marriage Act is about being true to the best of the soul of America—decency, dignity, and love.
https://t.co/ftYi8vYR5R
Ten years ago, I said marriage is about a simple proposition: 

Who do you love? 
Will you be loyal to the person you love?

The Respect for Marriage Act recognizes that everyone should have the right to answer those questions for themselves, without government interference.
Starting January 1, seniors with diabetes on Medicare are going to pay no more than $35 a month for their insulin prescription. 

That's genuine savings for seniors. This matters to many families with loved ones who have diabetes and rely on insulin to survive.
Today is a good day. https://t.co/wOFfv6RUwX
Today, I signed the Respect for Marriage Act into law. 

We are reaffirming a fundamental truth: Love is love, and Americans should have the right to marry the person they love.
Some welcome news on the economic front. https://t.co/xii4FwC4Hf
The Respect for Marriage Act will safeguard the rights and protections to which LGBTQ+ and interracial couples and their children are entitled. 

It will also ensure that LGBTQ+ youth will grow up knowing that they can lead full, happy lives and build families of their own. https://t.co/pa9xQbNMKJ
For the first time since 1934, every single senator in a sitting president's party won reelection in a midterm—plus, Pennsylvania elected @JohnFetterman.

Looking forward to working together to deliver for the American people in the new year. https://t.co/mlZtXeDwJi
The “Butch-Lewis Act” in the American Rescue Plan allowed us to cover over 1,000 employers and 350,000 union workers and retirees facing benefit cuts of up to 60% starting in the next few years if we hadn’t acted.
The American Rescue Plan helped keep multi-employer pension plans for union workers and retirees solvent for decades to come. 

This week, we announced our plan to prevent drastic cuts to workers’ hard-earned pension benefits that were scheduled to occur in the next few years.
By including the “Butch-Lewis Act” in the American Rescue Plan, we shored up the pension plans for millions of union workers. It represents the most significant investment in pension security for union workers and retirees in the past 50 years.
The United States is a top destination for companies across the globe looking to make investments because we have a world-class, highly skilled, committed workforce.
We’re strengthening American manufacturing by creating 750,000 manufacturing jobs since I became president.
Georgia, today is Election Day—and the eyes of the nation are on you.

Head to the polls and help send @ReverendWarnock back to the U.S. Senate. https://t.co/1Y1bE3E02P
I was excited to join IBEW workers in Boston to phone bank for @ReverendWarnock.

Today, we learned that the economy added 263,000 jobs in November. 

We’ve now created 10.5 million jobs since I took office, the unemployment rate remains near a 50-year low, and wages for working families have gone up.
Today is the last day to vote early ahead of next Tuesday’s Georgia Senate runoff election.

Go vote for @ReverendWarnock who will continue fighting for you.
Link to my full letter to @TheDemocrats Rules and Bylaws Committee: https://t.co/VgkDuU5ljF
The Democratic Party has worked hard to reflect the diversity of America—but our nominating process does not. As @TheDemocrats' Rules and Bylaws Committee meets this week, here’s my letter on the principles I believe we as a party should allow to guide our process. https://t.co/qR4oVSC8tR
There is further evidence that my economic plan is working.

We learned that inflation moderated and incomes grew in October, following this week's news that our economy grew at an even stronger pace.

That's good news for the American people.
Republicans are pouring millions of dollars into the Georgia Senate runoff to defeat @ReverendWarnock.

But their efforts are no match for our grassroots team.

If you can, please consider donating to help reelect Senator Warnock.
https://t.co/iEofrmVbcz
Companies in every part of our country are expanding factories and building new ones to make electric vehicle batteries and chargers, which will create thousands of jobs in the process.
Georgia, if you haven’t voted early for @ReverendWarnock in the runoff: Don’t wait.

Confirm your polling place at https://t.co/1Y1bE3E02P now—then go vote. Let’s send him back to the U.S. Senate.
We’re building an economy that works for everybody. 

One that grows from the bottom up and the middle out, not the top down. https://t.co/nxjUVeoIqw
Georgia: Early voting is underway in the runoff, and we need your help to send @ReverendWarnock back to the U.S. Senate. 

Head to https://t.co/1Y1bE3E02P to make a plan to vote—then, remind your family and friends to make their plans to vote, too.
Folks, the work is not over—​​@ReverendWarnock is headed to a runoff.

That means the result of this election depends on what we do between now and December 6.

Today and every day, we have so much to be grateful for. 

Happy Thanksgiving to our service members and military families whose loved ones are on duty and unable to be with their families. We hope your day is filled with joy and gratitude.
I was honored to pardon Chocolate and Chip, our national Thanksgiving turkeys. https://t.co/sNcaI6NEqj
The Respect for Marriage Act will ensure that LGBTQ+ and interracial couples are respected and protected equally under federal law. I urge Congress to quickly send this bill to my desk, where I will promptly sign it into law.
We've taken steps to lock in vital infrastructure investments—delivering lower costs for clean energy, spurring good-paying union jobs for American workers, and advancing environmental justice in our communities. 

We are proving that good climate policy is good economic policy.
Donald Trump failed America. https://t.co/fylyocYcse
Today is the one-year anniversary of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the most significant federal investment in our nation’s infrastructure since Eisenhower’s Interstate Highway System.
One year after the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law was signed, it is already delivering progress on once-in-a-generation investments in our roads, bridges, clean water systems, high-speed internet access, and so much more.
The difference between talking and delivering. https://t.co/TC3X6H3nj0
In this year’s midterm elections, we saw the strength and resilience of American democracy in action. 

There was a strong rejection of political violence, voter intimidation, and election deniers at every level.

The American people proved—once again—democracy is who we are.
The American people overwhelmingly support our agenda:

Lower prescription drug costs
Making health care more affordable
Rebuilding America
Taking on the climate crisis
Making big corporations begin to pay their fair share in taxes

It matters.
Tuesday was a good day for America and a good day for democracy—and a strong night for Democrats. https://t.co/ANkzNLKJak
I will work with anyone on ideas to provide more breathing room for American families. And I will oppose any effort to undo my agenda or make inflation worse.

We are on the right path, and we need to keep moving forward to build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out.
Our nation has a truly sacred obligation to prepare those we send into harm’s way, care for their families when they’re gone, and care for them and their families when they’re home. 

That’s a lifetime commitment the nation owes to every one of our veterans. https://t.co/d11FFcxeTd
I want to thank the young people of this nation who voted in historic numbers—again—just as you did 2 years ago.

Yesterday was a good day for democracy and a good day for America.

Our democracy has been tested in recent years. But with their votes, the American people have spoken and proven once again:

Without a single Republican vote in Congress, congressional Democrats finally beat Big Pharma.

Republicans in Congress have already introduced legislation to ban the right to choose nationwide, but if we elect more Senate Democrats and keep control of the House, we will codify Roe v. Wade as the law of the land.
Earlier this month, we helped lower the cost of hearing aids. We made them available over the counter, which could save up to $3,000 a pair for millions of Americans with hearing loss.
When I think of character, I think of @JohnFetterman.

History and common sense tell us that liberty, opportunity, and justice thrive in a democracy—not in an autocracy.

At our best, America is not a zero-sum society where for you to succeed, someone else must fail.

The promise of America is big enough for everyone to succeed.
All of us who reject political violence—and I believe that is the overwhelming majority of Americans—all of us must unite to make it absolutely clear violence and intimidation have no place in America.
Democracy is more than a form of government. It’s a way of being. A way of seeing the world.

A way that defines who we are, what we believe, and why we do what we do.

Democracy is simply that fundamental.
American democracy is under attack because the defeated former president of the United States refuses to accept the results of the 2020 election.

He refuses to accept the will of the people.

He refuses to accept the fact that he lost.
We are facing a defining moment. An inflection point.

We must with one overwhelming, unified voice speak as a country and say there is no place for voter intimidation or political violence in America, whether it’s directed at Democrats or Republicans.

If we elect more Democrats to the Senate and keep the House, here is the promise I make to you and the American people: The first bill that I will send to Congress will be to codify Roe v. Wade. https://t.co/CvyB3xUzAK
The previous president made a string of broken promises in places like Wisconsin, Indiana, and Ohio, where promised investments and jobs in manufacturing never materialized, but layoffs and shuttered factories did. 

Now, Made in America isn't just a slogan. It's a reality.
The final say on Roe v. Wade does not rest in the court. 

It does not rest with extremist Republicans in Congress.

If you do your part and vote, Democratic leaders in Congress will do their part. I’ll do my part. With your support, I will sign a law codifying Roe in January.
Republicans are determined to hold the economy hostage. Either give in to their demands to cut Social Security and Medicare, which millions of Americans rely on, or they’ll crash the economy. 

Let me be clear: I will not cut Social Security and Medicare.
In 2020, you voted and delivered the change you wanted to see in the world.

In 2022, you need to exercise your power to vote again for the future of our nation.
This election is a choice between two vastly different visions for America. 

Democrats are reducing everyday costs and lowering the deficit. 
Republicans are fiscally reckless and pushing tax cuts for the wealthy.
Under my watch, the economy has added nearly 700,000 manufacturing jobs. The last guy had a different track record.

I want to remind us how we felt when Roe v. Wade was overturned.

Anger.
Worry.
Disbelief.
 
The unbelievable fact that the Supreme Court didn’t just fail to preserve a constitutional freedom—it took away a right. 

If you care about the right to choose, you have to vote.
While Republicans have boldly stated that they want to cut Social Security and Medicare, Democrats will protect these programs. 

The choice couldn't be clearer.
Today, we got further evidence that our economic recovery is continuing to power forward. This is a testament to the resilience of the American people.

The Third Quarter GDP report shows that Americans’ incomes were up and price increases in the economy came down.
The extreme Republicans who have spent decades trying to overturn Roe v. Wade have no clue about the power of women.

With just over two weeks to go until the midterm elections, I’m thanking Democratic staff and volunteers who are getting out the vote and discussing the progress we’ve made under our leadership—including 10 million jobs since I came into office. Tune in.

If we elect two more Democratic senators and keep control of the House, here is my promise to the American people:

Republican leaders said if they get their way, they're going to extend the Trump tax cuts and repeal the minimum corporate tax of 15% that I just signed into law. 

They would allow the many largest corporations in America to go back to paying zero in federal income tax.
Let's look at the facts: The federal deficit went up every single year in the Trump administration. 

On my watch, things have been different. The deficit has come down both years that I've been in office.

MAGA forces are determined to take this country backwards.

Backwards to an America where there is no right to choose, no right to privacy, no right to contraception, no right to marry who you love.

We can’t let that happen.
I will never apologize for helping middle- and working-class Americans as they recover from the pandemic.

Especially not to Republicans who voted for a $2 trillion tax cut in the last administration that mainly benefitted the wealthiest Americans and the largest corporations.
Everything Democrats have fought so hard for is on the ballot in November, and we can't stop our progress. 

Can you help support Democrats with a donation before midnight?
https://t.co/jSpb5AuNRI
My good friend @BarackObama knows what is at stake in the midterm elections. If we elect more Democrats to Congress, we can codify Roe v. Wade and move forwards, not backwards.

Go to https://t.co/Hy8C4n0lUk to make your plan to vote. 
https://t.co/o8CQYr38fM
Together, we'll restore the right to choose for every woman in every state in America.

We can do this if we vote. Make a plan to vote at https://t.co/Hy8C4mJiSk.
It’s time to pass an assault weapons ban to keep our communities safe. https://t.co/M8KqBGhFJY
The final say about your right to choose rests with you.

If you do your part and vote, Democratic leaders in Congress will do their part.

I’ll do my part.

With your support, I will sign a law codifying Roe in January.
https://t.co/Hy8C4n0lUk
We must elect more Democrats to the Senate and keep control of the House.

If we do that, here’s the promise I make to you and the American people:

The first bill I will send to Congress will be to codify Roe v. Wade. And when Congress passes it, I will sign it in January.
MAGA Republicans don’t have a clue about the power of American women, but they’re about to find out. Tune in to hear how we’ll codify Roe v. Wade into law. https://t.co/pxoUTlJmbL
In total, more than 40 million Americans can stand to benefit from student debt relief. About 90% of that relief is going to go to people making less than $75,000 a year.

Let me be clear: Not a dime will go to those in the top 5% income bracket. Period.
Republicans want a national ban on abortion—but if we elect two more Democratic senators and keep the House, we will codify Roe v. Wade. https://t.co/vyvNKzN1wG
With our votes, we have the power to move our country forward. Make a plan to vote early or on Election Day! https://t.co/Hy8C4mJiSk

Despite opposition from some of the most powerful special interests in the nation, we're lowering health care costs and strengthening Medicare. And we're fighting for folks who need our help.
A vast majority of House Republicans have signed on to a Republican budget to cut Medicare and Social Security.
Thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, no senior in America on Medicare will have to pay more than $2,000 a year for their prescriptions, no matter how much they cost.
Instead of Infrastructure Week being a punch line under my predecessor, Infrastructure Decade is a headline on my watch.
When it came time to help our seniors, every single Republican in Congress sided with Big Pharma. https://t.co/3R51RX5lMN
Yesterday, I issued an Executive Order directing the Department of Health and Human Services to put a plan on my desk within 90 days finding additional ways to lower prescription drug costs for seniors.
Next month, voters will have to decide. 

Democrats are working to bring down the cost of things talked about around the kitchen table—from prescription drugs to health care and more. 

Republicans are campaigning every day on an agenda to raise your costs.
The choice is clear. https://t.co/eHHawQoTsP
Social Security benefits will go up by an average of $140 a month.

For the first time in 10 years, Social Security checks will go up while Medicare premiums go down.
The Inflation Reduction Act locks in lower health care premiums for 13 million people, lowers seniors’ prescription drug prices, and caps their out-of-pocket expenses for prescription drugs at the pharmacy at $2,000 per year.
We have 25 days left until the midterm elections to elect Democrats up and down the ballot. 

You can support @TheDemocrats’ efforts to fight back against MAGA Republicans ahead of this critical election by chipping in before the FEC deadline: 
https://t.co/fFpE7Ynaqu
So much is at stake in these midterm elections, folks. https://t.co/6faoJ4nwia
In my first year in office, I protected more lands and water than any American president since John F. Kennedy. After the previous administration rolled back protections, I restored full protections to three national monuments in Utah and New England.
Imagine if we elect two more Democrats to the Senate and keep the House. We'll codify Roe v. Wade, protect voting rights, and so much more.

Check your voter registration at https://t.co/Hy8C4mJiSk today.
We capped insulin costs for people on Medicare, but a lot of our Republican friends said, “No, we’re not going to do it for other people.” https://t.co/aKtDlTKiaA
Today, using authorities under the Antiquities Act, I’m establishing the Camp Hale Continental Divide National Monument. 

This is the first new national monument of my presidency under this authority.
In this November’s midterm elections, Democrats, Independents, and mainstream Republicans can come together to reject extreme MAGA Republicans. https://t.co/v8K5KwNzc3
Senator Rick Scott has made it clear that he thinks Social Security and Medicare should be on the chopping block every five years. But we won't let him and the MAGA Republicans try to get their way: https://t.co/Hy8C4mJiSk.
158 House Republicans have signed on to a Republican budget that would cut Social Security and Medicare.

I have a different idea: I’ll protect Social Security and Medicare and make them stronger.
With only 28 days until the midterm elections, the stakes are clear: Republicans want a national abortion ban. Democrats want to codify Roe. 

Can you contribute to help elect Democrats up and down the ballot? 
https://t.co/udGGj8j2jJ
Ask yourself: Do you want to put your Social Security into the hands of Ted Cruz and Marjorie Taylor Greene? https://t.co/cs7XYruduV
Every single Democrat voted for the Inflation Reduction Act.

Every single Republican voted against it.
Republicans want a national ban on abortion—but if you give me two more Democratic senators and Democrats keep the House, I promise you we will codify Roe v. Wade. https://t.co/lkE2epWZiL
The CHIPs and Science Act will help ensure tens of thousands of new, high-paying construction jobs.
Our economy created 263,000 jobs last month. That's 10 million jobs since I came into office—the fastest job growth at any point of any president in all of American history.
If you’re on Medicare, your insulin will be capped at $35 a month thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act.

We wanted to cut the cost of insulin for everyone—including hundreds of thousands of children with Type 1 diabetes—but Republicans voted to strike that out of the bill.
Republicans had no problem enacting a $2 trillion tax cut that overwhelmingly benefitted the wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations.

Now, thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, corporations will have to pay a minimum corporate tax of 15%.
We’re building a clean energy economy, and we’re doing it from the bottom up and the middle out.
MAGA Republicans can’t be pro-law enforcement and pro-insurrection. https://t.co/VXfRDwcUmc
Today's jobs numbers are an encouraging sign that we are transitioning to stable, steady growth. And more Americans are working than ever before. 

There's more to do to grow our economy from the bottom up and middle out, but we're making progress.
This year’s elections are absolutely critical. Get involved at https://t.co/V9MzpvQJcq. https://t.co/oEUS8NQ2S8
Many Republicans have called the Bipartisan Infrastructure program “socialist.” Then, they asked for money from it.

You can’t make this stuff up. https://t.co/yQVHlM3vYw
Last year, a family of four saved an average of $2,400 through the American Rescue Plan I signed into law. And now, the Inflation Reduction Act locks in place those lower health care premiums for millions of families who get their coverage through the Affordable Care Act.
The United States must lead the world in producing semiconductor chips, and the CHIPs and Science Act is going to make sure that it will.
Extreme MAGA Republican Senator Ron Johnson wants to put Social Security and Medicare on the chopping block every year.

This guy never gives up. 

But we never give up either.
Sending people to prison for possessing marijuana has upended too many lives and incarcerated people for conduct that many states no longer prohibit. That's before you address the clear racial disparities around prosecution and conviction. 

Today, we start to right these wrongs.
The CHIPs and Science Act makes historic investments in companies to build advanced manufacturing facilities here in America. 

Now IBM is investing $20 billion to design and manufacture semiconductors, mainframe technology, and quantum computers.
Too many lives have been upended because of our failed approach to marijuana.

Today I announced a pardon of all prior federal offenses of simple possession of marijuana, urged governors to do the same, and asked HHS and DOJ to review how marijuana is scheduled under federal law.
The world is changing. We can either shape it, or we can be shaped by it. I believe we have an enormous opportunity to build back a country that is even better than before.

Can I count on you to join us? https://t.co/V9Mzpw8kB0
Congressional Republicans are doubling down on their extreme position with a proposal for a national abortion ban. That means even if you live in a state where extremist Republican officials are not running the show, your right to choose will still be at risk.
I wish I could say Republicans supported our progress in reducing health care costs and strengthening Medicare. That would be good for all of America.
 
But when it actually came time to do something about inflation around the kitchen table, every one of them voted no.
Congress should codify the protections of Roe v. Wade and do it once and for all. 

But right now, we're short a handful of votes, so the only way it's going to happen is if the American people vote in November.
I signed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act into law, the first major gun safety legislation in nearly 30 years. I’m not going to stop until I again get an assault weapons ban passed.
MAGA Republicans don’t have a clue about the power of women. They are about to find out. https://t.co/akmHFkuOXS
We're not going to sit by and let Republicans throughout the country enact extreme policies to threaten access to basic health care.

That's why we have taken a number of actions to protect access to reproductive health care, including emergency medical care.
For years, there has been no check on how high or how fast Big Pharma can raise drug prices. But thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, that ends now. 

If Big Pharma tries to raise drug prices faster than inflation, they'll be penalized and have to rebate the money to Medicare.
If you’re on Medicare and you have diabetes, your insulin is going to be capped at $35 a month.
Senator Ron Johnson said if Republicans get control of Washington, they’re coming after the Affordable Care Act again, denying protections for anyone with a preexisting condition. 

These guys never stop.
Get in, folks. We're building a better America: https://t.co/V9Mzpw8kB0 https://t.co/cMKiF0Lqwz
Today, I announced more than $60 million in funding to help coastal areas in Puerto Rico become better prepared for storms. 

In addition, nearly $700 million in infrastructure investments in Puerto Rico have been announced since I signed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.
My dad used to say, “Joey, don’t compare me to the Almighty. Compare me to the alternative.”

And here’s the deal: Democrats want to codify Roe. Republicans want a national ban on abortion. The choice is clear.
Republicans are always talking about the deficit. Well, guess what? The last guy increased the debt with tax cuts for big corporations. Not a penny of it was paid for. 

This year, we've reduced the deficit by more than $1 trillion.
In the past 24 hours, we've approved four more counties in Florida for individual disaster assistance in addition to the nine counties we announced yesterday. 

The federal government will cover 100% of the cost to clear the massive debris left in the wake of the hurricane.
My message to the people of Florida and to the country: At times like this, America comes together. We’re going to pull together as one team, as one America.
In 42 days, democracy is on the ballot. Americans will have to choose between the MAGA Republican platform—embracing extremism and the Big Lie—and Democrats, independents, and mainstream Republicans who believe in the rule of law.
This morning, we got good news about lower costs. The Department of Health and Human Services announced that the premium for Medicare Part B will decrease next year. 

For years, that fee has gone up. Now, for the first time in more than a decade, it's going to go down.
There is so much on the line in these midterm elections. With just a few weeks to go, we need your help to protect and expand our Democratic majorities in Congress.

Can you chip in to help elect Democrats today?
https://t.co/QOggr7BzbZ
Democracy cannot survive when one side believes there’s only two outcomes to an election: either they win, or they were cheated.

That’s not democracy. And that’s where the vast majority of MAGA Republicans are today.  

You can’t love your country only when you win.
This November, we have a choice to be a nation of hope, unity, and optimism, or a nation of fear, division, and darkness. https://t.co/zUkNiGUHZh
The power to get this done is in the hands of the American people. https://t.co/dhdDg2GGbC
Senator Lindsey Graham has proposed a national ban on abortion that would put criminal penalties on doctors. 

This November, if Republicans win control, they will vote for a nationwide ban on abortion. But if you give me two more Democrats in the Senate, I will codify Roe.
If Republicans control the Congress, Social Security will be on the chopping block. But if you support Democrats, I promise you: Social Security will be protected. Period.
It’s time to pass the assault weapons ban. I’ve taken on the NRA, and I beat them before.

I plan on doing it again. https://t.co/SkQOe0VnLS
The MAGA Republicans didn’t side with law enforcement; they sided with the insurrectionists. 

Don’t tell me you support law enforcement if you can’t condemn what happened on January 6. You can’t be pro-law enforcement and pro-insurrection.
When I came to office, the economy was flat on its back—millions out of work. 

So we acted quickly. We passed the American Rescue Plan, which lifted this nation from economic crisis to economic recovery. And every single Republican voted against it.
We beat Big Pharma. Now, Medicare will have the power to do what so many Democrats and many Republicans in the past talked about doing: lowering prescription drug prices. https://t.co/sOMdwSuXKE
In February, I laid out our plan to supercharge the Cancer Moonshot that is bold, ambitious, and completely doable. 

The goal is to cut cancer death rates by at least 50% in the next 25 years and to create a more supportive experience for our patients and families.
Every single Republican in Congress voted against the Inflation Reduction Act.

When it came time to actually do something about inflation, Republicans said no.
If you give me two more Democratic senators, and Democrats keep the House, I promise you we will codify Roe v. Wade.

We will once again make Roe the law of the land.

We will once again protect a woman’s right to choose.
At @NEAToday to highlight the choice voters have between building an economy that works for working families, and the Republican plan to make health care more expensive, ban abortion nationwide, and put Medicare and Social Security on the chopping block. https://t.co/eYxWRRsJFC

We passed the most extensive gun legislation in 30 years and I'm not going to rest until we get assault weapons banned. Our kids should be learning how to read and write, not duck and cover. https://t.co/ZOiHY2PXnc
To address the inequities in cancer treatment, the Cancer Moonshot allows us to ensure prevention, detection, and treatment reach patients in urban, rural, suburban, and Tribal communities, so they have equal access to cancer diagnostics, therapeutics, and clinical trials.

An assault weapons ban.
Voting rights.

It’s all on the line in November.

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will invest $25 billion to modify our airports. 

From airports serving small towns to major cities, it matters.
The MAGA Republicans believe that for them to succeed, everyone else has to fail. I believe America is big enough for all of us to succeed, and that is the nation we’re building: a nation where no one is left behind.
Every single Republican in Congress voted against lowering costs for Americans—now every single American needs to return the favor and vote them out of office. https://t.co/xT78xqO1g7

MAGA forces are determined to take this country backwards. 

Backwards to an America where there is no right to choose, no right to privacy, no right to contraception, no right to marry who you love.
Thanks to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, I'm pleased to announce we're approving funding for the first 35 states to build their own electric charging infrastructure throughout their state. They will be part of a network of 500,000 charging stations throughout the country.

We're going to build the future here in the United States of America with American workers, American companies, and with American-made products.
Thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, folks on Medicare won’t pay more than $2,000 a year for their prescriptions.
Let’s be clear: Democrats sided with the American people with the Inflation Reduction Act, and every single Republican in Congress sided with special interests.

That’s the choice we face.
Today, we celebrate the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, which will create jobs, make our tax code fairer, and lower costs for American families.

Every single Republican in Congress voted against it.
Throughout our history, America has often made the greatest progress, coming out of some of our darkest moments. I believe we can, and must, do that again, and we are.
Millions of retirees were at risk of losing their retirement security, so with the American Rescue Plan, we protected their pensions. It’s one of the most significant achievements for union workers and retirees in over 50 years. 

Not a single Republican voted for it.
Today, we share this solemn rite of remembrance and reflect on all that was lost in the fire and ash on September 11, 2001. For twenty-one years, we still kept our promise to never forget, and we will keep the memory of those precious lives stolen from us.
Democrats offer a vision for a better America. It’s in our hands if we just get out and vote. https://t.co/mFRVN2Gtgz
Every Republican in Congress voted against lowering prescription drug costs, health care costs, tackling the climate crisis, lowering energy costs, creating good-paying jobs, and a fairer tax system.
 
Every single American needs to return the favor and vote them out of office.
Through the CHIPS and Science Act, we're going to support entrepreneurs and technology hubs across the country, including HBCUs, Minority-Serving Institutions, and Tribal colleges. We're going to tap into the greatest advantage we have: our diverse and talented workforce.
Since I took office, our economy has created nearly 10 million new jobs and 668,000 manufacturing jobs. Proof that ‘Made in America’ is no longer just a slogan. It's a reality today—and it's just beginning.

Republicans have pushed an ultra-MAGA agenda to: 

—Threaten Social Security and Medicare
—Raise taxes on working families 
—Give big corporations and billionaires tax breaks

Working-age women are now back at work at rates not seen since before the pandemic. Wages are up, and unemployment remains near a 50-year low.
For a long time, we’ve told ourselves that American democracy is guaranteed, but it’s not. https://t.co/cCswKfQ9BO
We have now created nearly 10 million new jobs since I took office—the fastest growth in American history.
Too much of what’s happening in our country today is not normal. Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans represent an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our republic. https://t.co/ekJztMxhST
In August, the economy created 315,000 new jobs. 

American workers are back to work earning more, manufacturing more, and building an economy from the bottom up and the middle out.
The MAGA Republicans look at America and see carnage and darkness and despair.

I see an America with an unlimited future.

An America that is about to take off.
MAGA Republicans don’t understand what every truly patriotic American knows.
You can’t love your country only when you win.
For a long time, we’ve reassured ourselves that American democracy is guaranteed. But it is not.

We have to defend it.
Protect it.
Stand up for it.

That’s why tonight, I am asking the nation to come together and unite behind this single purpose—of saving our democracy.
There are far more Americans — far more Americans — of every background and belief who reject the extreme MAGA ideology than those who accept it.

And it is within our power to stop this assault on America.
Donald Trump and MAGA Republicans tried everything last time to nullify the votes of 81 million Americans.

This time they’re determined to succeed in thwarting the will of the people.
Donald Trump and MAGA Republicans are a threat to the very soul of this country.
Donald Trump and MAGA Republicans represent an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our Republic.

They don't respect our Constitution.

They don't believe in the rule of law.

And they don't recognize the will of the people.
This is what Rick Scott’s election-year plan says: 
All federal legislation sunsets every five years. If a law is worth keeping, Congress can pass it again. 

Translation: 
Your Social Security, every five years, will be eliminated unless it's voted back into existence.
I am determined to ban assault weapons in this country. I did it once before, and I’ll do it again.
MAGA Republicans have awakened a powerful force in America: the women of this nation. https://t.co/p93C0GmuFQ
For decades, climate deniers blocked any meaningful progress in dealing with the climate crisis, but not this year. Thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, we’re taking the most aggressive action to confront the climate crisis ever.

The American Rescue Plan took America from an economic crisis to an economic recovery. And not a single Republican voted for it.
We’ve come a long way. COVID no longer controls our lives, there are a record number of Americans working, businesses are growing, and our schools are open. 

Even in the face of unrelenting attacks from the most powerful special interests in the country, we got it done.
Every single Republican member of Congress voted against the support for law enforcement in the American Rescue Plan. Every single one.
The extreme MAGA Republicans have made their choice: to go backwards, full of anger, violence, hate, and division. 

We’ve chosen a different path: forward, the future, unity, hope, and optimism. We choose to build a better America.
There are 70 days until the midterm elections. 

It's all on the ballot: Social Security and Medicare. Choice. Voting rights. But we can have the last word. Electing Democrats in November is critical to keep moving our country forward. 

Register to vote: https://t.co/Hy8C4mIL2M
Thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, if you’re on Medicare and you have diabetes, your cost of insulin will be capped at $35 a month.
We just passed the first significant new gun safety legislation in nearly 30 years in this country.

We’ll protect voting rights.

Let’s get it done. https://t.co/QpVj0GzYVP
Every single Republican who voted against the Inflation Reduction Act voted against capping insulin prices for Medicare recipients at $35 for a month's supply.

Why the Republican caucus would support pharma and continue the price gouging for insulin is beyond me.
MAGA Republicans have awakened a powerful force in America—the women of this nation.

These MAGA Republicans don’t have a clue about the power of women in America. 

They are about to find out.
Senator Ron Johnson wants Social Security and Medicare on the chopping block every year. He's the same guy who said if Republicans get control of Congress, they'll try to get rid of the ACA again—denying insurance to people with preexisting conditions.

These guys never stop.
—American Rescue Plan
—Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
—Bipartisan Safer Communities Act 
—PACT Act 
—CHIPS and Science Act

All this progress is part of our vision, plan, and determined effort to get the job done for the American people.
In this moment, those who love this country—Democrats, Independents and mainstream Republicans—must be stronger, more determined, and more committed to saving America than MAGA Republicans are committed to destroying America.
Every single one. https://t.co/0dTB6Awz8T
Our middle-class families deserve breathing room. 

It’s the whole reason I ran for president.

Do you want to put your Social Security into the hands of Ted Cruz or Marjorie Taylor Greene?
Under my student debt relief plan, almost 90% of the benefit will go to folks making less than $75,000 a year.
10 million jobs—more than ever created before at this point of a presidency. 
3.5% unemployment rate—a near record low in the history of this country. 
More than 220 million Americans were vaccinated. 
Record small business creation. 

That’s our economic record.
Every Republican in Congress voted against lower prescription drug prices.
 
Against lower health care costs.
Against a fairer tax system.
Against tackling the climate crisis.
Against lowering your energy costs.
Against creating good-paying jobs.

They chose the already-powerful.
Wall Street didn’t build this country. You did. The working people—the middle class—built this nation. And unions built the middle class.

We won’t let anyone or anything tear America apart.
Every election is a choice. My dad used to say: “Don’t compare me to the Almighty. Compare me to the alternative.”

Well, the alternative to the Democrats is the MAGA Republicans.
Every single Republican voted against:
❌ Lowering prescription drug prices
❌ Lower health care costs
❌ Tackling the climate crisis
❌ Lower energy costs
❌ Creating good-paying jobs
❌ A fairer tax system
We had to take on the big drug companies to pass the Inflation Reduction Act.

For decades, Big Pharma fought to block giving Medicare the power to negotiate for lower prices.

And, for decades, Big Pharma won.

Not this year. The American people won. And big pharma lost.
In 2020, 81 million Americans voted to save our democracy.

That’s why Donald Trump isn’t just a former president. He’s a defeated former president.

Now, you need to vote to save democracy again.
In Maryland to discuss what’s at stake in this election and how we will continue to deliver for the American people. Tune in now.

Yesterday, we put out a plan to bring relief to millions of working and middle-class people with student loans.

We’re keeping my campaign promise and forgiving up to $10,000 of federal student loan debt for individuals making less than $125,000 a year.
The Inflation Reduction Act is a loss for Big Pharma. 

This is a win for the American people—for you.
My plan to address student loan debt is responsible, fair, and focuses the benefit on middle-class and working families. https://t.co/IVp95AfuYW
I will never apologize for helping working Americans and the middle-class. https://t.co/tZ9HTu744j
Today, we’re meeting my campaign commitment with targeted debt relief to folks from families who need it most. 

If you received a Pell Grant while in college and make less than $125,000 a year, you are eligible for up to $20,000 in debt reduction. https://t.co/1soacSBajg
We'll no longer have a situation where 55 of the largest corporations in America pay zero in federal income taxes on $40 billion in profits thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act.

And no one making less than $400,000 per year will pay a penny more in federal taxes.
The Inflation Reduction Act caps insulin prices for Medicare recipients at $35 for a month's supply. 

It's a game changer.
In this historic moment, Democrats sided with the American people—and every single Republican in the Congress sided with the special interests. 
https://t.co/NblX0IhwKR
The Inflation Reduction Act will reduce the deficit without raising a penny in taxes on people making under $400,000 a year.
Today, there are more people working in America than before the pandemic began. In fact, there are more people working in America than at any point in American history.
I remember sitting at my mom and dad’s dining room table and watching them choose which bills they were going to pay that month because there wasn’t enough money to pay all of them. That’s why I’m doing everything in my power to lower costs for families.
The Inflation Reduction Act caps out-of-pocket expenses for prescription drug prices at no more than $2,000 a year for Medicare recipients.
Let's be clear: At this historic moment, Democrats sided with the American people, and every single Republican in Congress sided with special interests.

https://t.co/ll2x4Nc7Kj
From the fundamental right to privacy to the benefits we depend on, like Social Security and Medicare—so much is at risk in this midterm election.

Two years ago, I accepted the Democratic Party’s nomination for president.

I'm incredibly grateful for the trust you have put in me and @KamalaHarris. Since then, we've made historic infrastructure investments, achieved record job growth, and began rebuilding our economy. https://t.co/Q1dKniGpLq
The Inflation Reduction Act is the biggest step forward on climate ever.  

It includes ensuring that we create clean energy opportunities in frontline and fenceline communities that have been smothered by legacy pollution and it will help fight environmental injustice.
We're seeing a stronger labor market where jobs are booming and more Americans are working than ever in history. That's what happens when you build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out—it gives everyone a chance to get ahead.
We passed the Inflation Reduction Act while keeping my campaign commitment: No one earning less than $400,000 a year will pay a single penny more in federal taxes.
Every single Republican who voted against the Inflation Reduction Act voted against:

— Lower prescription drug prices
— Lower health care costs
— A fairer tax system
— Tackling the climate crisis
— Lowering energy costs
— Creating good-paying jobs
Democrats voted to cut the deficit to fight inflation by having the wealthy and big corporations pay their fair share. Every single Republican opposed requiring big corporations to pay a minimum tax of 15%, instead of some getting away with paying $0 in federal income taxes.
Thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, we are giving Medicare the power to negotiate for lower prescription drug prices. 

Despite big drug companies spending millions to beat this law, we prevailed.
The Inflation Reduction Act will take the most aggressive action ever to confront the climate crisis and strengthen our energy security.
The Inflation Reduction Act is one of the most significant laws in our history. The American people won and the special interests lost. https://t.co/pXlnmnWNYU
The Inflation Reduction Act will help save money on prescription drugs, cut health care premiums, cut energy costs, take aggressive action on climate, and make large corporations pay their fair share in taxes.

We got it done. https://t.co/XjdkNkOpov
Democrats sided with the American people with the Inflation Reduction Act, and the Republicans sided with special interests. 

That's the choice we face: Whether we protect the already powerful or have the courage to build a future where everybody has an even shot.
Thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, America is going to take the most aggressive action we’ve ever taken in confronting the climate crisis and strengthening the energy security of America and the world.
With the final passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, the American people are going to see lower prescription drug prices, lower health care costs, and lower energy costs, and big corporations are finally going to start to pay their fair share.
The PACT Act will mean new facilities, improved care, and retention of health care workers treating veterans. This new law matters.
A key driver of our economic recovery is the resurgence of America's small businesses. We learned recently that small businesses with less than 50 employees created nearly 3 million jobs in 2021—the most ever in a single year.
I was proud then, and I'm even prouder to serve with you now, @KamalaHarris. https://t.co/Mhxm2pS4GE
It's been two years since I announced @KamalaHarris as my running mate. She’s a fearless fighter and the best partner I could have for the work ahead. https://t.co/BZxx5Nd7EQ
Today, we're one step closer to fulfilling our sacred obligation with the PACT Act, the most significant law our nation has passed to help millions of veterans who are exposed to toxic substances during their military services.
I will always fight for the care and benefits veterans have more than earned and deserve. https://t.co/bgpRc0hPfH
In just 90 days, voters must choose between ultra-MAGA Republicans who are attacking our freedoms, and Democrats who are fighting to defend them.

Make sure you're registered to vote: https://t.co/Hy8C4mIL2M
One of the ways we’re giving working people a fighting chance is by making health care, prescriptions, energy, and so much more affordable and accessible through the Inflation Reduction Act.
Today, I signed the CHIPS and Science Act into law, a once-in-a-generation investment in America itself.

A law the American people can be proud of. https://t.co/sS5bGkNQkV
The Inflation Reduction Act caps seniors’ out of pocket spending for prescription drugs at $2,000 per year.
The Inflation Reduction Act makes the largest investment ever in combating climate change.

It addresses the climate crisis and strengthens our energy security, creating jobs manufacturing solar panels, wind turbines, and electric vehicles in America with American workers.
Let me be clear:

We're going to invest in America. 
We're going to make it in America. 
We're going to win the economic competition of the 21st century in America.
I ran for president promising to make government work for working families again, and that is what the Inflation Reduction Act does—period.
Today, Senate Democrats passed the Inflation Reduction Act, siding with American families over special interests, voting to lower the cost of prescription drugs, health insurance, and energy and reduce the deficit while making the wealthiest corporations pay their fair share.
The CHIPS Act will supercharge our efforts to make semiconductors here in America. It will make cars, appliances, and computers cheaper and lower the costs of everyday goods. And, it will create high-paying manufacturing jobs across the country.
The PACT Act is the biggest expansion of VA health care in decades, and the largest single bill ever to comprehensively address exposure to burn pits.

I look forward to signing this bill, so veterans and their families get the benefits and health care they earned and deserve.
The voters of Kansas sent a powerful signal that this fall, the American people will vote to preserve and protect their rights and refuse to let them be ripped away by politicians. 

We have your back.
This week, I signed an executive order to make sure health care providers comply with federal law, so women don't face delays or denials of medically necessary care. 

It builds on the first one I signed last month that will also help safeguard access to health care.
We’ve taken another step toward reducing inflation and costs for America’s families. 

The Inflation Reduction Act would help save money on prescription drugs, health premiums, and much more. It will not raise taxes on those making less than $400,000.
The unemployment rate now matches the lowest it’s been in more than 50 years: 3.5%. 

More people are working than at any point in American history, and it’s the result of my economic plan to build the economy from the bottom up and middle out.
More than 35 million Americans are enrolled in Affordable Care Act related coverage—the highest on record.
Voters in Kansas rejected extreme efforts to amend the state constitution to take away a woman’s right to choose. 

This vote makes clear what we know: The majority of Americans agree that women should have access to abortion and the right to make their own health care decisions.
The bipartisan PACT Act is the biggest expansion of benefits for service-connected health issues in 30 years. Millions of veterans who may have been exposed to harmful toxins will have quicker access to health care services and benefits. 

I look forward to signing this bill.
126 economists wrote that the Inflation Reduction Act would lower costs for families, set the stage for strong economic growth, and tackle the climate crisis. 

Send it to my desk. https://t.co/nZpIpBFgj7
While COVID is still with us, our fight against this virus is making a difference. We can now protect ourselves from serious illness due to COVID, and COVID deaths are down nearly 90%.
These COVID tools are free, convenient, safe, and they work. https://t.co/Y63EqER9b5
Let me be clear:

The Inflation Reduction Act would be the most significant legislation in history to tackle the climate crisis and improve our energy security right away. 

Let's pass it for the American people.
By making more semiconductors in the United States, the CHIPS and Science Act will increase domestic manufacturing and lower costs for families.

I look forward to signing this bill into law and continuing to grow our economy for working families across the country.
The Inflation Reduction Act would lower health care costs for millions of Americans, and it would be the most important investment we've made in energy security and creating clean energy solutions for the future.

It's a big deal.
My message to Congress is this:

The Inflation Reduction Act is the strongest bill you can pass. It will lower inflation, cut the deficit, reduce health care costs, tackle the climate crisis, and promote energy security. https://t.co/YtF1h7G7R5
Brave women and men in uniform across America should never forget that the defeated former president of the United States watched January 6 happen and didn’t have the spine to act.
You can’t be pro-insurrection and pro-cop. 
You can’t be pro-insurrection and pro-democracy. 
You can’t be pro-insurrection and pro-American.
https://t.co/DCHprpK9Sx
I grew up in a family where if the price of gas went up, we felt it.

Gas prices have dropped since mid-June and should continue to come down in the days and weeks ahead. I know those extra dollars and cents mean something.
With oil prices coming down 20% from June highs, it's unacceptable that prices at the pump have only come down by half as much.

It's time for oil and gas companies to pass these lower costs on to Americans.
Americans have seen gas prices drop by about 60 cents a gallon in the last month, saving the average driver about $30/month.

An extra 60 cents a gallon back in your pocket is meaningful. It's breathing room. 

And we're not done working to lower costs for families.
The price of oil is down about 20% since mid-June, but the price of gas has so far only fallen half as much. 

Oil and gas companies must not use this moment as an excuse for profiting by not passing along savings at the pump.
The Supreme Court’s decision on Dobbs was received by Republicans in Congress as a green light to go further and try to ban abortion nationwide.

Make no mistake: The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act is real progress, but more has to be done. https://t.co/lpKTdsTM33

Make no mistake: The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act is real progress, but more has to be done. https://t.co/7cVhPoTCG1
The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act closes the boyfriend loophole, so if you are convicted of assault against a dating partner, you cannot buy a gun.

​​If we keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers, we can save the lives of their partners and stop more mass shootings.
The action we take today on gun violence is a step designed to make our nation the kind of nation it should be.
 
It's about the most fundamental things: the lives of our children and our loved ones. https://t.co/GRL2KhBDcA
Republicans voted against protecting retirement and pensions, but had no problem passing a $2T tax cut that benefited the wealthiest Americans. They choose to make life more comfortable for the ultra-rich while opposing retirement security for working people.
Last week, I had the honor of recognizing an extraordinary group of Americans with the Presidential Medal of Freedom—our nation's highest civilian award. 

These individuals are all working to ensure the idea of America shines like the sun to light up the future of the world. https://t.co/K0CpmUtKYs
We’ve seen the risk millions of workers face as they watch their pensions turn into broken promises. Now that we are implementing the Special Financial Assistance program, millions of workers will have the retirement they earned.

Zero Republicans voted for this legislation.
This week, I was proud to award the Medal of Honor to four soldiers who performed acts of incredible heroism during the Vietnam War. 

They stood in the way of danger and risked everything to defend our nation, and they are finally getting the recognition they deserve. https://t.co/g0H0T9BEnT
This is why elections matter. https://t.co/KW3nENBtgr
Extreme Republicans have not only fought to take away our rights, but they are determined to go as far as they can. https://t.co/oP1YbNZMaO
The fastest way to restore Roe is to pass a national law codifying Roe, which I will sign immediately upon its passage.

We need two additional pro-choice senators and a pro-choice House to codify Roe as federal law. Your vote can make that a reality. https://t.co/qrNBCzbhDg
Today, I signed an executive order to protect the reproductive rights of women in the aftermath of the Supreme Court's extreme decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.

It formalizes the actions I announced right after the decision and will add new measures to protect women's health. https://t.co/EujXCMAwFR
We have more Americans working in the private sector today than any day during the former president's time in office. 

In the second quarter of this year, we created more jobs than in any quarter under any of my predecessors in the nearly 40 years before the pandemic.
Today we learned that our private sector has recovered all of the jobs lost during the pandemic, and added more.

There’s more work to do, but this recovery would not have been possible without the actions we took to fix a broken COVID response and pass the American Rescue Plan.
This week, I joined union workers and retirees in Cleveland to announce the implementation of the Special Financial Assistance program, which will protect millions of workers who faced significant cuts to their retirement before the passage of the American Rescue Plan. https://t.co/Q9vt34BFSH
If states try to block a woman from getting medication the FDA has already approved and that has been available for more than twenty years, we will act to protect that woman’s right to that medication.
If extremist governors try to block a woman from traveling from a state that prohibits her from seeking the medical help she needs to a state that provides that care, we will act to protect her bedrock rights.
Congress must act to codify Roe and the filibuster should not stand in the way. 

But right now, we don’t have the votes to change the filibuster. That means we need to elect more Democratic senators and reelect our House majority in November to get this bill to my desk.
This fall, Roe is on the ballot. Personal freedoms are on the ballot.  

Until then, we will do everything within our power to ensure that women have access to the medication they need and that they will have the freedom to travel to seek the care they need.
While we celebrate the Fourth of July, I am thinking of the countless service members who have pledged their lives to defend our nation and democracy around the world. 

We are forever in debt to those who sacrifice so much to keep us safe.
We will protect a woman’s access to medications approved by the FDA, like contraception, which is essential for preventative health care, and have taken steps to ensure that these critical medications are available to the fullest extent possible.
Bipartisan members of Congress came together to heed the call of families across the country and passed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act to address the scourge of gun violence in our communities.

Kids in schools and communities will be safer because of it.
The Supreme Court’s ruling in West Virginia vs. EPA risks damaging our nation’s ability to keep our air clean and combat climate change.

We cannot ignore the existential threat the climate crisis poses. Our fight against climate change must carry forward, and it will.
We have to codify Roe vs. Wade into law. 

If the filibuster gets in the way, we should provide an exception to the filibuster to deal with the Supreme Court decision.
COVID-19 vaccinations are available for children under five years of age. More and more locations are ramping up appointments, and more vaccines are being delivered to providers in your areas every day. 

This is a monumental step forward.
My message to all LGBTQ+ youth: 

Be you. 

You are loved. 
You are heard. 
You are understood. 
You belong. 

And we have your back.
This is an extreme and dangerous path the Court is now taking us on. https://t.co/qqCG5tGGkl
With your vote, you can act. You can have the final word. This is not over. https://t.co/oFNyakELLz
I'd like to thank members of the House and Senate for working to get the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act done, and the families I've met with who lost loved ones to gun violence. 

They led the way so other families won't have to experience the pain they had to live through.
This morning, I signed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act into law—the most significant gun safety law in the last 30 years. The bill:

—Includes red-flag laws
—Closes the “boyfriend loophole”
—Requires young people ages 18 to 21 to undergo enhanced background checks

And more.
I’ve warned about how overturning Roe risks a broader right to privacy for everyone.

The right to make the best decisions for your health. 
The right to marry the person you love.

With your vote, you can act. You can have the final word. This is not over.
This decision is a culmination of deliberate efforts over decades to upset the balance of our law. https://t.co/ginEwqrTn4
We need to restore the protections of Roe as law of the land. We need to elect officials who will do that. https://t.co/fnDEKiWnzI
It's a sad day for the country. 

Nearly 50 years ago, Roe vs. Wade was decided. Today, the Supreme Court of the United States expressly took away a constitutional right from the American people. 

Personal freedoms are on the ballot this fall.
This fall, we must elect more senators and representatives who will codify a woman’s right to choose into federal law. We need to elect more state leaders to protect this right at the local level. We need to restore the protections of Roe as law of the land.
50 years ago today, Title IX transformed our nation, benefitting millions of women and girls.

As we look ahead, I am committed to protecting this progress and working to achieve full equality, inclusion, and dignity for all Americans.
I'm deeply disappointed by the Supreme Court’s ruling in New York State Rifle &amp; Pistol Association v. Bruen. This ruling contradicts common sense and the Constitution, and should deeply trouble us all. 
 
I remain committed to doing everything in my power to reduce gun violence.
With vaccines, treatments, and other tools widely available, more than 220 million Americans are vaccinated, more than 100 million Americans have their booster shot, and daily deaths due to COVID-19 are down 90%.

We've come a long way in our fight against COVID-19.
Since I took office, we've been committed to making sure every parent has the opportunity to protect their children from COVID-19. 

Starting this week, you can go to https://t.co/EwdQ2dXioe and find information and appointments near you. https://t.co/RRO6auk1j7
We're taking additional steps to increase pay for our nation's federal firefighters. 

These actions will temporarily put back pay into firefighters' pockets, increasing their bi-weekly checks by up to 50% of their annual base salary for two years.
The United States is now the first country in the world to offer safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines for children as young as six months old.

For the first time in our fight against this pandemic, nearly every American can now have access to life-saving vaccines.
The Ocean Shipping Reform Act will help lower shipping costs and bring down prices on products that American families need and ensure that American farmers, ranchers, and other exporters are treated fairly.
The ultra-MAGA agenda is attacking families and our freedom.

300 discriminatory anti-LGTBQ+ bills have been introduced in states. In Texas, they’re knocking on doors to investigate parents raising trans kids.

These attacks are real and consequential for families.
During the pandemic, nine major shipping companies increased their prices by as much as 1,000%, earning $190B in profit.

The Ocean Shipping Reform Act I signed into law will crack down on these ocean carriers and help bring down prices for American families and businesses.
Ask yourself:

How well are you going to sleep at night knowing that every five years ultra-MAGA Republicans are going to vote on whether you’ll have Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid?
https://t.co/ztt2wHno46

In May, the economy ​​added 390,000 jobs, bringing the total to 8.7 million jobs created since I took office—an all-time record.
All I’m asking is for the largest corporations and the wealthiest Americans to begin to pay their fair share in taxes. 

I made this commitment from the beginning. Nothing’s changed. 

No one making less than $400,000 will pay a single penny more in federal taxes.
We've come a long way in a short time.

Before we were sworn in, so many Americans lost their jobs that my predecessor became the second president in history to leave office with fewer jobs than when he took office. https://t.co/ODjyCY3ktO
I continue to call on Congress to pass the PRO Act, which will make it easier for workers to organize. 

I’m not just saying that to be pro-union. I’m saying that because I’m pro-American.
When I ran for office, I said I wanted to rebuild the backbone of the economy: the middle class.

Because everybody does better when everybody is in on the deal.
Under my predecessor, the deficit rose every single year he was in office.

Under my plan, we’re on track to cut the deficit by $1.7 trillion this year—the largest decline in American history. https://t.co/QGmjNPOklQ
When I took office, the economy had stalled and COVID was out of control. Since then, we’ve achieved the most robust recovery in modern history. 

Because of that foundation, we’re better positioned to overcome global inflation and reach a new chapter of stable and steady growth.
When I hear “climate,” I think jobs. 

Good-paying, high-quality jobs that will help speed our transition to a green economy of the future and unleash sustainable growth.
Unions built the middle class. When you’ve got a union, workers’ voices are heard and heeded. They provide democracy in the workplace and allow people to have dignity and respect in their work.
When we invest in strengthening workers and the middle class, the poor have a ladder up, and those at the top still do just fine. 

That’s how we can increase opportunity and decrease persistent inequity.
One of my favorite parts of the job is when I get to meet our incredible supporters across the country. My team and I are hosting a sweepstakes to join me at one of our events.

Less than 1% of the population risks everything to defend our nation, our values, and everything we hold dear.

Veterans are the backbone of who we are as a country.
This week, I signed nine different bills with overwhelming bipartisan support to improve care for our veterans and honor their service and sacrifice. 

We must equip those that we send into harm's way and care for them and their families when they come home.
Republicans talked about it, but we oversaw a deficit reduction of $350 billion last year—and we're on target to reduce the deficit by the end of the fiscal year by $1.7 trillion.
It costs drug companies $10 to develop a vial of insulin, but some families can pay as high as $1,000 a month for this lifesaving drug.

That’s flat-out wrong—and it’s why I’m fighting to cap the cost of insulin at $35/month.
While my economic agenda has put us in a better fiscal position—strengthening Social Security and Medicare—congressional Republicans have put forward a different approach.

Led by NRSC Chair Rick Scott, their plan would put these programs on the chopping block every five years.
We cannot fail the American people again.

In 1994, Congress passed a bipartisan assault weapons ban. Nine categories of semi-automatic weapons were included, like AK-47s and AR-15s. 

In the 10 years it was law, mass shootings went down. After Republicans let the law expire in 2004, mass shootings tripled.
Here's what the overwhelming majority of American people believe we must do.
https://t.co/u4MJuv6tCd
Over the last two decades, more school-aged children have died from guns than on-duty police officers and active-duty military combined. Think about that. 

How much more carnage are we willing to accept? How many more innocent lives must be taken before we say enough?
Thanks to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we're making critical investments in our climate and physical infrastructure to help increase our nation's climate resilience—from beginning to replace pipes to expanding our clean energy technologies.
In Buffalo and Uvalde, I spent hours with family members whose lives will never be the same. They had one message for all of us: 

Do something.

It's time for Congress to pass universal background checks and ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.
I grew up in a family where it mattered when the price of gas or groceries rose—that’s why fighting inflation is my top economic priority. 

By reducing health care costs, fixing supply chains, and making housing more affordable, we’re creating an economy that works for everyone.
In less than a year and a half, we’ve achieved the strongest job market in decades and the fastest decline in unemployment on record. 

Fighting inflation is a top priority, but Americans can have confidence that our economy faces this challenge from a position of strength.
I understand how difficult this formula shortage has been for families across the country. 

That's why we're using every tool available to increase supply, get more baby formula on shelves, work with manufacturers to reopen factories, and ramp up production quickly.
We’ve added 545,000 manufacturing jobs since I took office—and more manufacturing jobs were created in 2021 than in any year in nearly 30 years.

This is no accident. It is a direct result of my economic plan to grow the economy from the bottom up and middle out.
Pride is about courage and justice.

Since my first day in office, I've signed a comprehensive executive order to protect LGBTQ+ rights, reinforced federal protections for transgender kids, and launched a whole-of-government initiative to advance equity in LGBTQ+ communities.
I want every member of the LGBTQ+ community to know you are loved just as you are. 

During Pride Month, we celebrate the contributions of the LGBTQ+ community and will continue fighting for every person to be treated with the dignity they deserve. https://t.co/HkJ7xaIDu5
These kinds of mass shootings rarely happen anywhere else in the world.

Why are we willing to live with this carnage? Where in God's name is our backbone to have the courage to stand up to the gun lobby? 

It is time to turn this pain into action.
To lose a child is to have a piece of your soul ripped away. It is never quite the same.
 
And it’s the feeling shared by the siblings, grandparents, families, and communities left behind.
 
I ask the nation to pray for them, to give them strength in the darkness they feel.
The Ultra-MAGA Republicans’ proposal puts Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid on the chopping block every five years.
I proposed a minimum tax for corporations that asks them to pay their fair share in taxes. 

Senator Scott’s plan lets them off scot-free.
Republicans don't want to solve inflation by lowering costs. They want to solve it by raising taxes and lowering your income.
Under my predecessor, the deficit increased every single year he was president.  

Last year, the deficit was reduced by $350B. And this year, we're on track to cut the federal deficit by $1.5T—the biggest decline in debt ever in American history.
Rebuilding America with union labor is smart for business.  

Why? When union workers are on the job, projects are completed efficiently and professionally, and they ultimately save money.
Unions allow workers to maintain their dignity. 

It's a lot more than just paychecks and benefits, it's about the dignity of workers.
We're working to make sure safe baby formula gets to all who need it by:

- Invoking the Defense Production Act to increase domestic production 
- Launching Operation Fly Formula to use federal planes to fly formula in from abroad
We cannot remain silent.

In America, evil will not win, I promise you. Hate will not prevail. And white supremacy will not have the last word.
Three years ago, I kicked off my campaign for president in Philadelphia. Since then, we've gotten to work making historic infrastructure investments, creating record job growth, and rebuilding our economy.

There's more work ahead of us, but we’re building a better America. https://t.co/lnJkwd84KY
We’ve reduced the deficit by $350 billion, and we’re on track to reduce the deficit by $1.5 trillion this fiscal year.

There’s more work to do, but this has never happened before in American history.
Electing @JohnFetterman to the United States Senate would be a big step forward for Pennsylvania’s working people. https://t.co/k5HguGZSTb
A plan by Republican Senator Rick Scott would increase taxes on 70% of the American public and put Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid on the chopping block every five years.

Under my plan, no one making less than $400,000 will see their taxes increase.
On the International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia, and Biphobia, we stand in support and solidarity with LGBTQI+ people in the United States and around the world.

When I ran for office, I said I wanted to rebuild the backbone of our economy—the middle class.

Because I believe that everybody does better when everybody is in on the deal. https://t.co/0BTVvg2bde
There are a whole range of issues that are susceptible if the leaked opinion on Roe v. Wade ends up being the actual Court opinion. 

It’s not just choice that’s at stake here.
You want to bring down inflation?

Let’s make sure the wealthiest corporations pay their fair share.
During my first year in office, American agriculture exports shattered all previous records—$177 billion last year alone.

We have to keep investing in our farmers to reduce prices for consumers.
Republicans in Congress are so deeply committed to protecting big corporations that they would rather raise taxes on working American families.
https://t.co/1Z0v3YTNyC
Republicans love to attack me as a big spender. Let's compare the facts.

Under my predecessor, the deficit exploded, rising every single year. Under my plan, we are on track to cut the federal deficit by $1.5 trillion by the end of the fiscal year.
Senator Rick Scott’s ultra-MAGA agenda could raise taxes on 75 million American families, over 95% of whom make less than $100,000 a year. 

Their plan is going to make working families poorer.
https://t.co/ARj00d35Zi
To protect the right to choose, voters need to elect more pro-choice senators this November, and return a pro-choice majority to the House. If they do, Congress can pass this bill in January, and put it on my desk, so I can sign it into law.
Once again – as fundamental rights are at risk at the Supreme Court – Senate Republicans have blocked passage of the Women’s Health Protection Act, a bill that affirmatively protects access to reproductive health care.
High-speed internet is not a luxury any longer. It's a necessity. 

That's why the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law included $65 billion to make sure we expand access to broadband internet in every region of the country—urban, suburban, and rural.
I encourage Congressional Republicans to join us in our efforts to lower prices for families across the country, by making more in America, strengthening our supply chains, and cutting energy and prescription drug costs.
My mom believed the greatest virtue of all was courage, and that someday the bravery that exists in every heart will be summoned.

When I took office, there were around 20 million people relying on unemployment benefits to feed their families; today, that number is around 1 million—the lowest since 1970. 

We are building an economy that values the dignity of work.
There have been only 3 months in the last 50 years where the unemployment rate in America is lower than it is now. 

This is a direct result of the American Rescue Plan, our COVID vaccination program, and my plan to grow our economy from the bottom up and middle out.
The Republican plan led by Senator Rick Scott of Florida would tax half of our small business owners an extra $1,200 a year on average.

My plan would make it easier to start a small business by expanding their access to capital.
Today, we learned that the economy created 428,000 jobs in April—bringing the total number of jobs created since I took office to 8.3 million.

There's more work to do, but our plans and policies have produced the strongest job creation economy in modern times.
All the talk about the deficit from my Republican friends—I love it. 

The deficit was reduced by $350 billion in my first year in office, and we are on track to reduce it by another $1.5 trillion.
My plan to reduce the deficit would help reduce inflationary pressures and lower everyday costs for families.

My plan lets Medicare negotiate the price of prescription drugs. We can cap the price of insulin at $35 instead of the hundreds of dollars for some families.
While there’s still more work to do, we’re on track to cut the federal deficit by another $1.5 trillion by the end of this fiscal year—the biggest decline in a single year ever in American history.
Let me tell you about this Ultra-MAGA Agenda.
https://t.co/Cl41pqMEX1
Senator Rick Scott released an Ultra-MAGA Agenda.

It could raise taxes on 75 million American families. 

Under this new plan, while big corporations and billionaires would pay nothing more, working-class folks are going to pay a hell of a lot more.
If the Court overturns Roe, it will fall on our nation’s elected officials at all levels of government to protect a woman’s right to choose. 

And it will fall on voters to elect pro-choice officials this November.
I believe that a woman’s right to choose is fundamental. Roe has been the law of the land for almost fifty years, and basic fairness and the stability of our law demand that it not be overturned.

We will be ready when any ruling is issued.
As the proud husband of an educator, I've seen firsthand the dedication and selflessness of our nation's educators. 

Teaching isn't what @DrBiden does, it's who she is. On Teacher Appreciation Week, we honor teachers' work to build confidence and inspire curiosity. https://t.co/oyYOyt5cfc
Last year, we saw businesses with fewer than 50 workers create 1,900,000 jobs for the first three quarters of 2021 alone. 

While there’s still more work to do, that's the highest rate of small business creation ever recorded in a single year.
The Republican proposal, led by Senator Rick Scott, would raise taxes on 6.1 million small business owners—including 82% of small business owners who earn less than $50,000 a year. 

That’s just not right.
The people who made a difference in my life, in a fundamental way, were teachers.

This National Teacher Appreciation Week, we honor their service and passion and celebrate the immeasurable contributions of our nation’s educators in schools from coast to coast.
I grew up in a family where, when prices went up for things like gasoline, it became a discussion at the kitchen table. We felt it. 

That's why I'm focused on doing everything I can to lower the cost of gas and energy and accelerate our transition to clean energy.
Just as Putin chose to launch this brutal invasion, he could make the choice to end it. 

Russia is the aggressor, and the world must and will hold Russia accountable.
Our party is working to ensure that we can expand our Democratic majorities in the years to come—and we need your help to do it.

With the help of the American Rescue Plan, local governments were able to add a record 279,000 new educators in 2021 and nearly 46,000 teaching jobs in the first months of 2022.
Thanks in large part to the American Rescue Plan, last year, Americans applied to start 5.4 million new businesses—20% more than any other year on record.

The American economy is strong because our small businesses are strong.
Twelve years later, Republicans still haven't stopped their attacks on the Affordable Care Act. 

If they have their way, 100 million Americans with preexisting conditions could once again be denied health care coverage by their insurance companies.
The Republican plan led by Senator Rick Scott of Florida would tax half of our small business owners an extra $1,200 a year on average. https://t.co/2kHWJDrxq3
Through decades of organizing, negotiating, picketing, and protesting, labor unions secured vital workplace protections that union and non-union workers rely on today, and we are working to strengthen both unions and the workplace protections they provide.
Not only do Republicans oppose making big corporations pay their fair share—they want middle class families and small business owners to pay more in taxes.
A stronger economy built from the bottom up and the middle out puts greater power in workers' hands to improve their lives, provide for their families, and choose higher quality, higher-paying, and safer jobs.
Democrats are working tirelessly to open doors for more outstanding entrepreneurs.

But the Republican plan led by Senator Rick Scott would tax half of our small business owners an extra $1,200 a year on average.
American workers are beginning to rebuild our nation's roads, bridges, ports, and waterways.

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will create new jobs, modernize communities across the country, and open infrastructure jobs to people of all backgrounds.

Ensuring worker safety is a national priority and a moral imperative.

On Workers Memorial Day, we honor and remember those who lost their lives on the job and reaffirm every worker's basic right to a safe and healthy workplace.
Thanks to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we’re going to start replacing 100% of the lead pipes and water lines that go into homes and schools in this country.

Every American, every child, should be able to turn on a faucet and drink water that’s clean.
The unemployment rate for veterans is 2.4%—tied for the lowest rate on record. 

There is still more work to do, but this historic progress is the result of rebuilding America’s economy from the bottom up and the middle out.
Through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we’re investing $25 billion to upgrade and modernize American airports.
The United States will ban Russian-affiliated ships from our ports.

That means no ship that sails under the Russian flag or that is owned or operated by a Russian interest will be allowed to dock in a United States port or access our shores. None.
Thanks to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we’re going to plant 1.2 billion trees across the country to begin the vital work of reforesting America. It makes sense and also makes a big difference in our cities and on our city streets.
On Earth Day, we’re committed to building a future where everyone has clean air to breathe, clean water to drink, and healthy communities to work and live.

By investing in climate resilience and infrastructure, and a clean energy future, we can tackle the climate crisis head-on.
Putin has failed to achieve his grand ambitions on the battlefield.

President Zelenskyy and his democratically elected government remain in power, and Ukrainian armed forces—joined by brave Ukrainian civilians—have thwarted Russia's conquest of their country.
Our unity at home and our unity with allies, partners, and the Ukrainian people is sending an unmistakable message to Putin: He will never succeed in dominating and occupying all of Ukraine. That will not happen.
I’m doing everything I can to bring down prices to address Putin’s Price Hike.  

That’s why I authorized the release of 1 million barrels per day on average for the next six months from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
Thanks to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we’re making the most significant investment in modernizing our roads and bridges since the Interstate Highway System was built under President Eisenhower.
Our recovery so far has led to the creation of 7.9 million new jobs—more jobs created over the first 14 months than any president ever. The unemployment rate is at 3.6%, down from 6.4% in January 2021.

We have more work to do, but America is on the move.
While Congressional Republicans are proposing big tax increases on middle-class families, I am fighting for tax cuts for the middle class and to ensure that the super wealthy and large corporations pay their fair share.
The difference couldn’t be clearer:

Under the Congressional Republican Tax Plan, 75 million middle-class families’ taxes will increase an average of almost $1,500 a year.

Under my plan, no one making less than $400,000 will have their taxes raised.
When we build more in America, we increase economic capacity, and ultimately it helps lower everyday prices for families.
https://t.co/hWTyRb4kIL
From day one, every action I've taken to rebuild our economy has been guided by one principle—made in America. It means using products, parts, and materials built right here in the United States. It means bringing manufacturing jobs back and building supply chains here at home.
To help deal with Putin’s Price Hike, I’ve authorized the use of 1 million barrels per day on average for the next six months from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve—the largest release of our national reserve in history.
America is back to work. 

Our economy added 7.9 million jobs since I took office—more jobs created on average per month than under any other president in history. That’s millions of families with a little more breathing room and the dignity a job provides.
Today is a good day—a day that history is going to remember. https://t.co/gskJzbu2DK
Congratulations, Ketanji Brown Jackson. https://t.co/CGe6fdl7gk
Over the last four weeks, fewer Americans filed initial claims for unemployment insurance than any time in our nation’s recorded history. 

While we have more work to do to lower costs for families, today’s data demonstrates that America is on the move again.
Today, we enshrine in law our recognition that the Postal Service is fundamental to our economy, to our democracy, to our health, and the very sense of who we are as a nation.
If Republicans have their way, up to 100 million Americans with preexisting conditions could once again be denied health care coverage by their insurance companies.

I’ve got a better idea. Instead of destroying the Affordable Care Act, let's keep building on it. https://t.co/jqtoDPgekn
Over 31 million people now have health insurance through the Affordable Care Act.
4 out of 5 Americans can find quality coverage for under $10 a month.
The average family is saving $2,400 a year on their premiums.

The Affordable Care Act is stronger now than it has ever been.
Mr. President, welcome back to the White House.

Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has driven up gas prices and food prices all over the world. 

To help deal with that, yesterday I authorized the release of 1 million barrels per day for the next six months from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
Over the course of my presidency, our recovery has now created 7.9 million jobs—the most jobs created over the first 14 months of any presidency, in any term, ever.

Today, I'm authorizing the release of 1 million barrels of oil per day for the next six months—over 180 million barrels—from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. This is a wartime bridge to increase oil supply until production ramps up later this year.
My Billionaire Minimum Income Tax is fair, and it would raise $360 billion that can be used to lower costs for families and cut the deficit.

Under my budget, nobody making less than $400,000 a year would pay a penny more in federal taxes
My budget includes historic deficit reduction, historic investments in our security at home and abroad, and an unprecedented commitment to building an economy where everyone has a chance to succeed.
My budget makes the investments needed to reduce costs for families and make progress on my Unity Agenda—including investments to cut the costs of child care and health care; help families pay for other essentials; end cancer as we know it; and support our veterans.
My budget would further reduce the deficit by continuing to support the economic growth that has increased revenues and ensuring that billionaires and large corporations pay their fair share.
We are on track to reduce the federal deficit by more than $1.3 trillion this year, cutting in half the deficit from the last year of the previous administration and delivering the largest one-year reduction in the deficit in U.S. history.
A dictator bent on rebuilding an empire will never erase a people's love for liberty. 

Brutality will never grind down the will to be free. Ukraine will never be a victory for Russia.
Rather than breaking Ukrainian resolve, Russia's brutal tactics have strengthened their resolve. Rather than driving NATO apart, the West is now stronger and more united than it's ever been.
Russia's economy was ranked the 11th biggest economy in the world before this invasion. 

It will soon not even rank among the top 20 in the world.
The darkness that drives autocracy is ultimately no match for the flame of liberty that lights the souls of free people everywhere.

This historic progress is no accident: it’s the result of an economic strategy to grow the economy from the bottom up and middle out.
The Affordable Care Act that was signed into law 12 years ago was the first step in ensuring that everyone has access to affordable health care. I am proud that since November 2021, 14.5 million Americans have signed up for quality, affordable coverage.
On the anniversary of the Affordable Care Act being signed into law, know that as long as any American lies awake at night wondering how they’re going to pay their medical bills, we will keep fighting to lower costs and further expand health coverage.
Twelve years ago today, I watched President Obama sign the Affordable Care Act into law. I was proud to serve as vice president every day, but never more so than on that historic day. https://t.co/14wgXW6Fvc

We will not let autocrats and would-be emperors dictate the direction of the world.
Before I took office, people were hurting and we had to act. We passed the American Rescue Plan without a single, solitary Republican vote. 

Few pieces of legislation in our history have done more to lift the country out of crisis.
Putin was counting on a divided NATO, a divided West and quite frankly, a divided America.

But he got none of that.
We will not let autocrats and would-be emperors dictate the direction of the world. https://t.co/HH7gJazdmP
Few pieces of legislation have done more to lift us out of this crisis than the American Rescue Plan.

It fueled our efforts to vaccinate the nation.
Delivered immediate economic relief for millions of Americans.
Helped cut health insurance costs.

It was just the beginning.
Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, we lifted this country out of crisis and added more jobs to the economy in a single year than any other administration.
Unlike the $2 trillion tax cut passed in the previous administration that benefitted the top 1% of Americans, the American Rescue Plan helped working people and left no one behind.

It's why our economy has recovered faster than other major global economies.
One year later, American Rescue Plan is helping millions of families on Affordable Care Act plans save $2,400 a year on their health premiums. 

Let’s make those savings permanent.
When Vice President @KamalaHarris and I took office, there was no national plan to get Americans vaccinated and jump-start our economy.

The American Rescue Plan helped us get 500 million shots in arms and set off the greatest single year of job growth in our history.

—500 million shots in arms
—The fastest single year of job growth in our history

With all the bright spots in our economy—record job growth and higher wages—too many families are struggling to keep up with the bills. Inflation is robbing them of the gains they might otherwise feel. 
 
I get it. That’s why my top priority is getting prices under control.
A large contributor to inflation this month was an increase in gas and energy prices as markets reacted to Putin’s aggressive actions. 

I know that higher prices impact a family’s budget, which is why I am fighting to bring down the everyday prices that are squeezing Americans.

Thanks to my Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we will strengthen the region's economy, provide clean drinking water, and create more good-paying jobs. https://t.co/3qmGaFZR0g
17 Nobel Prize winners in economics say the Build Back Better Agenda will ease longer-term inflationary pressures.

We can get this done.
If Congress passes our Build Back Better Agenda, we can lower costs for working families with a stroke of a pen.
My Build Back Better Agenda would lower child care costs, helping parents get back to work. This will help reduce the burden on hardworking families and give them the breathing room they’ve needed. 
https://t.co/f56piST17T
Under the Build Back Better plan, no one making under $400,000 per year will see their taxes go up a single penny.
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law includes $7.5B for states to start building a national network of electric vehicle chargers. Using American parts, these chargers will be installed up and down our highways and the benefits will ripple thousands of miles in every direction.
We're on track to build a convenient, reliable, equitable national public charging network so that, no matter where you live in America, charging an electric vehicle will be quick and easy. 

This foundation will help American automakers set the pace for electric vehicles.
The clean energy investments in my Build Back Better plan will set our country on track to create more good-paying jobs, lower energy costs for families, and combat the climate crisis—without raising costs for working families.
If it costs drug companies less than $10 to make a vial of insulin, there’s no reason Americans should pay over $300 for this life-saving medicine. 

Under my Build Back Better Agenda, we can cap co-pays for insulin at $35 a month.
Last year, the American Rescue Plan made affordable, quality coverage a reality for over 5M Americans. My Build Back Better Agenda extends that access by lowering prescription drug costs, capping costs for people on Medicare, and bringing greater transparency to hospital care.
Nearly one in four Americans struggle to afford prescription drugs. 

Nearly 30% have skipped doses—or cut pills in half—because they can’t afford the costs.

The Build Back Better Agenda will help lower prescription costs and make these life-saving drugs more affordable.
No American should have to ration or avoid refilling prescriptions because they cannot afford them. My Build Back Better Agenda would help change this. https://t.co/l1aUkcJqJ4
We’re gearing up to make all 600,000 federal government vehicles electric, bringing more manufacturing jobs back to our country, and building supply chains here at home. We’re making “buy American” a reality—not just a promise.
Last year saw the highest increase in U.S. manufacturing jobs in nearly 30 years. 

By investing in innovation and manufacturing, we’ll create thousands of additional jobs helping build America’s products here in America.
From my time as vice president to now, I'm making sure our country is built on good-paying union jobs because we know that when folks get a decent wage, not only do workers get a little breathing room, but everybody in the community does better.
Get vaccinated. 
Get boosted. 
Wear a mask while you’re in public. 

We are going to get through this together.
Folks, I am proud to call myself a union president because organized unions know how to get it done. And we are going to ensure that we build a better America for those who build this country—the middle class.
There’s a clear choice between a party that is focused on the future, and a party that’s focused on trying to relitigate the past. If you’re able, chip in to support electing Democrats who will help continue moving our nation forward.
https://t.co/GqkAHx3GwO
When we invest in innovation, it powers up the private sector to do what it does best: creating new technologies, new industries, and most importantly new good-paying jobs. These are the kinds of partnerships that help us build a made in America future. 

We can't slow down now.
Americans have missed more than 9 million cancer screenings in the last two years because of COVID-19. 

If you were supposed to get a cancer screening during the pandemic, call your primary care doctor today.
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will rebuild our nation’s roads and bridges, creating more good union jobs. And we’ll do it by supporting union-based apprenticeships, community colleges, and on-the-job trainings in manufacturing and construction.
I know that there is more work to do to repair the frustration and fatigue in our country as a result of the pandemic, but we have come a long way in one year. Life-saving vaccines and an increase in our supply of tests are helping us get on track to moving beyond the pandemic.
From the largest drop in the unemployment rate on record to the largest reduction in childhood poverty ever recorded in a single year, my first year in office saw the strongest economic growth in nearly 40 years. 

There’s more work to do, but America is on the move.
I know January was a hard month for many Americans. After almost two years, the emotional and physical weight of the pandemic has been incredibly difficult to bear for so many folks across the country.

But, despite the challenges, we have the tools to keep our recovery going. https://t.co/9pddR3Jr6z
Stronger law enforcement is critical to stopping gun crime, but it’s made more effective when we invest in strengthening our communities.

My comprehensive strategy makes sure cities and states have the tools they need to invest in proven, community-based tactics to reduce crime.
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law isn’t just about infrastructure—it’s about jobs.

We’re going to create good-paying jobs for Americans by modernizing our bridges, highways, roads, ports, and airports.
I committed to this fight when I was Vice President. It's one of the reasons why, quite frankly, I ran for president. Let there be no doubt: Now that I am president, this is a presidential White House priority. Period. https://t.co/sXKyYt2Cz5
The hardships of the past two years are hard to overstate. But please know that our country and economy are in a much better place today. There is still more work to be done, but we are doing everything we can to prepare for a future beyond the pandemic.
In January our economy created 467,000 jobs, exceeding all expectations. 

Over the last 12 months, our country added 6.6 million jobs—more than during any 12-month period in our nation’s history.
I've asked Congress to provide $200 million to invest in community violence intervention programs that can interrupt violence, mediate conflict, de-escalate, and succeed in preventing shootings. https://t.co/X7xvKPTLPG
We are supercharging the Cancer Moonshot. The goal is to cut the cancer death rate in half in the next 25 years. 

It’s bold. It’s ambitious. But it's completely doable.
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will reconnect communities by modernizing highways, repairing bridges, and making the largest investment ever in affordable, high-speed Internet. 

Our country has never made such significant investments. Now we are.
Get vaccinated. 
Get boosted. 
Wear a mask while you’re in public. 

We are going to get through this together.
To build a truly strong economy, we need a future that's made in America.
https://t.co/IFDZ05pw0R
This time last year, at-home tests were difficult to come by. Now, we’re making 1 billion at-home tests available to order to your home—for free.

As I said during a meeting with the National Governors Association, last year was the greatest year of job growth in American history. And we’ll keep it going in 2022. https://t.co/pEzLF2zDpF
Happy Lunar New Year to those celebrating throughout the nation and around the world. I’m grateful for the invaluable contributions the AAPI community has made to our society, economy, and culture. May the Year of the Tiger bring happiness, health, and prosperity to all.
Black History Month serves as both a celebration and a powerful reminder that Black history is American history, Black culture is American culture, and Black stories are essential to the ongoing story of America—our faults, our struggles, our progress, and our aspirations. https://t.co/nW7Fe3YbOx
Since I was sworn in, America has added an additional 367,000 good-paying manufacturing jobs in America—the highest increase in U.S. manufacturing jobs in 30 years.
Extreme weather cost the country $145 billion last year alone. And it’s not going to ease up.

Our Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests in our resilience, building roads higher, our levees stronger, and our power grids more durable so that they can stand up to extreme weather. https://t.co/PaxoP3kzXt
Fastest economic growth in nearly four decades.
Greatest year of job growth in American history. 

This is no accident. 

Our economic strategy is creating good jobs for Americans and making our companies more competitive. And it’s just the beginning.
After four decades and 28 years on the United States Supreme Court, I commend Justice Stephen Breyer’s life of service. His brilliance, his desire to know more, kindness to those around him, and his optimism for the promise of our country has made him a model public servant.
I’m keeping the commitment I made during my campaign for president—I will nominate the first Black woman to the United States Supreme Court.
https://t.co/aoVrliWiMH
Good-paying, decent jobs you can raise a family on. 
Jobs for the future. 
Jobs in every part of the country.

That’s what made in America is all about.
Please wear a mask. It’s an important tool to help stop the spread of the Omicron variant.
Get your booster shot.
Folks, we’re not going to give up. Some people may call what is happening now the new normal. I call it a job not yet finished. We are moving toward a time when COVID-19 won’t disrupt our daily lives. We may not be there yet, but we will get there.
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is going to upgrade everything from roads, bridges, airports, transit, railroad, to make our economy move faster and reduce prices for families. It's going to create better jobs for Americans across the country. We’ll be moving again.
There’s a clear choice in the midterms: there’s a party that works for people and is focused on the future—and a party that works for one man and is focused on relitigating the past. https://t.co/j82xpPppwx
Over the last year, we have seen the grit and determination of the American people in the face of some of the biggest challenges. But I believe the best days of our country are ahead of us. We will get through this. https://t.co/ViiocVN6Oc
While the Omicron variant may be a cause for concern, it’s not cause for panic. Between vaccines and boosters to masks and at-home tests, we have the tools to save lives and keep our businesses and schools open. https://t.co/8aqqDGmCVJ
More than 200 million Americans are vaccinated.
One billion free COVID-19 tests are available for Americans to order. 
More than 400 million free masks will soon be distributed to communities nationwide.

We will get through this pandemic together.
One year ago, we promised that we would move quickly to deliver results for working families. From getting shots in arms and getting people back to work, to passing laws to create jobs and rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, we are making progress for the American people.
Tune in tonight as Vice President @KamalaHarris and I host a grassroots event to celebrate what we’ve accomplished this past year and what’s next. RSVP now.
https://t.co/tBNkNnRQNw
One year ago, we started to write an American story of hope, not fear. 
Of unity, not division. 
Of light, not darkness.

An American story of decency and dignity.
Of love and of healing.
Of greatness and of goodness.

May this be the story that continues to guide us forward.
I've never been more optimistic about America's future. 
https://t.co/UzOdpHW5RB
Our first year was the greatest year of job growth in modern American history, including over 6 million jobs added—more in one year than ever on record. We have more work ahead, but I know we can do it together.
January 20, 2021 was a day of renewal and resolve for our nation. With hope, we set our sights on a nation we knew we could be and must be. 

And it was just the beginning. https://t.co/VDhqch8xU9
From getting more than 200 million Americans fully vaccinated to the addition of over 6 million new jobs, we’ve made record progress for working families over the last year.
A year ago, we set out to write the next chapter in the American story.

Join me and Vice President @KamalaHarris this Thursday for a virtual event as we reflect on our first year and look ahead to the future.
https://t.co/tBNkNnRQNw
On Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, we must protect the hard-fought gains he helped achieve—and continue his unfinished struggle for a freer and more just society by raising our voices to confront abuses of power, challenge hate and discrimination, and protect the right to vote.
If you have not gotten vaccinated, do it. Personal choice impacts all of us—our hospitals, our country. 

COVID-19 is one of the most formidable things America's ever faced. We have to work together, not against each other. We are the United States of America. We can do this.
Repairing and rebuilding our nation's bridges
Delivering clean water for every American
Expanding access to high-speed internet 
Building resilience against severe weather

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is making critical investments that we've never seen before.
Across the country, 45,000 of our bridges are in desperate need of repair. My Bipartisan Infrastructure Law includes $40 billion to make those repairs.
I’ve said it before: If you are unvaccinated, and test positive, you are 17 times more likely to get hospitalized.

The best way to keep yourself and your family safe is to get vaccinated, boosted, and wear a mask indoors and in public spaces.
21st century Jim Crow is about voter suppression and subversion—it’s about who gets to vote, who counts your vote, and whether your vote is counted.

The Senate must pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote Act.
It’s not enough to praise Congressman John Lewis’ memory. In order to follow in his footsteps, we must translate eulogy into action and support the bill in his name.

The Senate must pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote Act.
Last year alone, 34 laws were enacted in 19 states with provisions restricting voting rights.

What’s their end game? To turn the will of the voters into a mere suggestion. https://t.co/T9ufFTgqYz
The right to vote and to have that vote counted is democracy’s threshold liberty. Without it, nothing is possible.

This is about all of us. It’s about the people. It’s about America. https://t.co/nfBiII7uvk
I'll be clear: to protect our democracy, I support changing the Senate rules to prevent a minority of senators from blocking action on voting rights.
Since the start of my presidency, Republicans have done nothing but try to obstruct the country's economic recovery. https://t.co/WivbP7JWNF
From day one, my economic agenda has been different. It's been about taking a fundamentally new approach to our economy: one that sees the prosperity of working families as a solution, not the problem.
I believe the power of the presidency and the purpose is to unite this nation, not divide it. https://t.co/RzELTfTV9a
Right now, in states throughout the country, new laws are being written not to protect the vote, but to deny it. The former president and his supporters want not only to suppress the vote, but to subvert it. 

It’s wrong, undemocratic, and un-American.
Today’s a historic day for America’s economic recovery. https://t.co/PG8EAIk415
Folks, get your booster.
The FDA has now authorized booster shots for children ages 12 to 15. Vaccinating our children is the best way to protect them from the Omicron variant.
We must be absolutely clear about what is true and what is a lie. 

The former president did what no president in the history of this country has ever done: He refused to accept the results of an election and the will of the American people. https://t.co/QCWCcbofUM
Folks, I know we're all tired and frustrated about the pandemic.

But please, wear your mask in public to protect yourself and others. Get vaccinated and boosted. Take advantage of what resources we already have. We’ll get through this—together.
https://t.co/2CbSjLwOcG
Folks, we have a responsibility to see that America is an idea. One that requires vigilant stewardship.

As we stand here today, one year since January 6, 2021, we must be firm and resolute and unyielding in our defense of the right to vote and to have that vote counted.
I did not seek this fight brought to this Capitol one year ago today, but I will not shrink from it either. 

I will stand in this breach and defend this nation. I will not allow anyone to place a dagger at the throat of democracy. The will of the people will be heard. https://t.co/spR4EkrVb7
You cannot love your country only when you win. You cannot obey the law only when it's convenient. You cannot be patriotic when you embrace and enable lies.
Here is the truth about what we saw on January 6, 2021: Rioters menaced the halls of the Capitol. They were not looking to save the cause of America, but to subvert the Constitution. https://t.co/fvzTT3Czos
One year ago, democracy was attacked. 

For the first time in our history, a president tried to prevent the peaceful transition of power as a violent mob reached the Capitol. 

But they failed. We must work to ensure that it never happens again.
The COVID-19 vaccine and booster are our best defense to end this pandemic—and the best way to protect yourself and your loved ones. Get vaccinated.
Millions rely on public transit every day—to get to work, to school, to visit with family. But many communities, especially communities of color, lack sufficient transit options. 

My Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will expand public transit and replace outdated vehicles.
If you’re fully vaccinated and boosted, you are highly protected from the Omicron variant.

And we have enough vaccines to get every American fully vaccinated, including their booster shot. Get vaccinated, folks.
Folks, get vaccinated.
This year, we'll keep: 

Investing in America.
Rebuilding America.
And building a better America for all. https://t.co/TCdzmyDtrp
This new sinister combination of voter suppression and election subversion—it's un-American and it's undemocratic.

We must pass the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.
As we continue our holiday celebrations and head into the new year, remember that the best way to protect your health and keep your loved ones safe from COVID-19 and the Omicron variant is to get vaccinated and get your booster shot.
The most valuable tool we have to lower the costs of prescription drugs, child care, and health care for families is my Build Back Better Act. 

It’s fully paid for, will not increase the deficit, and won’t raise the taxes by one penny for anyone making less than $400,000 a year.
When it comes to voter suppression, it’s no longer just about making it easy for eligible people to vote—it's about whether or not those votes will count at all.

It's simple: voter suppression is un-American, un-democratic, and unpatriotic.
Sending warm wishes to all who are celebrating Kwanzaa this week. We hope these days of reflection on the seven principles bring light, happiness, and peace in the coming year.
On behalf of the entire Biden family, Jill and I want to wish you a very Merry Christmas. https://t.co/2dIRa6XIEV
Gas prices are down ten cents nationally, and some states across the country are seeing gas prices at pre-pandemic averages. This will help so many Americans who are traveling this week.
Packages are moving, gifts are being delivered, and shelves are stocked. Today, retail inventories are up more than 3% from last year. 

We’re making progress.
My Bipartisan Infrastructure Law includes the largest investment of public transit ever and will replace diesel buses with electric ones. This will get more people where they are going safer, faster, and cleaner for the environment. It’s a win, win, win.
Two years earlier than experts predicted, the economy has added nearly 6 million jobs and the unemployment rate is down to 4.2%. Let’s keep this historic progress moving by passing Build Back Better.
If you're over the age of 18 and six months have gone by since you got vaccinated, go get your booster. Go get it now.
We are not going back to March 2020. 

More than 200 million Americans have been fully vaccinated and today, we’re prepared for what’s coming. We must stay focused.
If you haven’t yet, please get vaccinated. It’s the best way to keep yourself and your loved ones safe from the Omicron variant. Now is the time. https://t.co/nLva52NSGI
Booster shots provide the strongest protection against the Omicron variant. That’s why I got my booster—and encourage everyone who’s eligible to do so as well. https://t.co/7sEoXNjr9D
There aren't a lot of things that almost every American can agree on. But I think it's safe to say that all of us can agree that prescription drugs are outrageously expensive in our country. 

Under my Build Back Better bill, which has passed the House, they won’t be.
Six months out from your second Pfizer or Moderna vaccine shot or two months out from your Johnson &amp; Johnson shot? 

Get your booster.
The shock of losing a home or business, the grief of losing a loved one during the holidays, is traumatizing. 

We are going to ensure that folks in Kentucky and all those affected by the tornadoes have all the mental health resources they need to get through this difficult time.
The Build Back Better Act will lower the core costs that have held Americans back for decades: on everything from health care and child care to prescription drugs and housing. 

No Republican in Congress supports it.
The American people deserve more than just a little breathing room—they deserve a real fighting chance to get ahead. The Build Back Better Act will prioritize families like yours and rebuild the backbone of America.
https://t.co/YXwRRtrmJ2
If you are vaccinated but still worried about the new variant, get your booster. 
If you aren't vaccinated, go get that first shot. 
We’ll fight the Omicron variant, together.
Life-saving, prescription medication shouldn’t break the bank.
https://t.co/DGDEm6QC1l
As we move into the winter and face the challenges of a new variant, this is a moment for us to put the divisiveness behind us. This is a moment for the nation to unite in a common purpose: To fight this virus, protect one another, and to protect our economic recovery.
Everybody talks about the price tag for the Build Back Better Act. 

But here’s the truth: If you make less than $400,000 a year, your taxes will not go up one single penny under our plan.
Health care should be a right in this country, not a partisan issue. Diabetes, cancer, and other diseases don’t care whether you're a Democrat or a Republican. 

This is about being able to afford the prescription drugs you need. Congress must come together and finish the job.
The pandemic has put a strain on our global supply chains and caused prices to rise around the world. 

The Build Back Better Act will help ease inflationary pressures, lower costs for the American people and extend tax cuts for working families.
Our 5-step plan to fight COVID-19 this winter: 
1. Expanding the nationwide booster campaign 
2. Launching new family vaccination clinics 
3. Making at-home tests available 
4. Increasing surge response teams 
5. Accelerating our efforts to vaccinate the rest of the world
Parents should never have to worry about whether their drinking water is safe for their children. 

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will start to replace 100% of our nation’s lead pipes and service lines so that every child across the country has access to clean and safe water.
America is entering this winter from a position of strength compared to where we were last winter. https://t.co/OE4gj0ZoCA

https://t.co/qbfXOe7GeN
Long gone are the days when we hear about infrastructure week with no follow through. From now on, we’re in the infrastructure decade.
17 Nobel Prize winners in economics say the Build Back Better Act will help ease long-term inflationary pressures and make our economy stronger. 

Not a single Republican in Congress supports it.
Americans that require insulin should not have to suffer and sacrifice just to get a drug that costs a few dollars to make. 

The Build Back Better Act will cap insulin at $35 a month.
https://t.co/Ox0att5OYa
Last year, more than half of the schools in America were closed. This year, 99% of schools are back open, and 20 million children ages 5 and older have already received their vaccine. Let’s keep it going.
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law builds back our bridges, water systems, power lines, electric grid better and stronger, making them more resilient to the effects of climate change. No American should have to deal with flooding or losing power for days and weeks after a storm.
Since I was sworn in on January 20, our economy has created nearly 6 million new jobs—a record for a new president.
https://t.co/Q0C99vrJYI
Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, we’ve cut child poverty in America by more than 40%. 

Many children who spent last Christmas in poverty will not this holiday season.
My Build Back Better bill takes three major steps to lower the cost for families dealing with diabetes:
1️⃣ Cap cost sharing for insulin at $35
2️⃣ Get health insurance for folks with diabetes who don’t already have it
3️⃣ Keep drug companies accountable when they raise prices
America continues to add jobs at a record pace and nearly 6 million new jobs have been created since I was sworn in on January 20. Our economy is moving in the right direction, but we have more to do.
Today, one in four Americans struggle to afford their prescription drugs, resulting in nearly 30% of patients either skipping doses or even cutting pills in half just to afford the costs. 

My Build Back Better Bill will change that.
Any country that out educates us will outcompete us. 

That’s why my Build Back Better Act will provide universal pre-K to every 3- and 4-year old in America and increase the maximum Pell Grant. This is how we invest in American families.
I’m proud to say that the typical American family has more money in their pockets than they did last year, or the year before that, thanks to the American Rescue Plan.
Time for action. https://t.co/7n23MWapzT
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $42 billion to modernize our ports and our airports, making it easier for companies to get goods to market, reducing supply chain bottlenecks, lowering costs for families, and making sure that what you need gets to your home on time.
Our infrastructure used to be rated the best in the world—that’s not hyperbole. But now we rank 13th in the world for the quality of our infrastructure.
 
With our infrastructure law, we're turning things around in a big way. And that starts with our roads and bridges.
What does passing the Build Back Better Act mean?

For millions of American families, it means the bills you're paying right now for daycare could be capped at 7% of your income.

It means the cost of your prescription drugs and care for your elder parents will be cheaper.
America has always been a nation of possibilities. Instead of continuing tax cuts for big corporations and the wealthiest Americans, let’s ensure they pay their fair share and lower the cost of child care and prescription drugs by passing the Build Back Better Act in the Senate.
There is no worse feeling than not being able to afford the life-saving medication a loved one may need. The Build Back Better Act will cap the cost of insulin at $35/month so families can breathe a little easier.
We can’t just build back to where we were before. 

When roads are continuously wiped out by flooding, we must build them higher. 
When high power lines come down from severe weather, they must be made more resilient. 

This is what I mean when I say we need to build back better.
Imagine running up higher costs for American families just to score a few political points. But that’s what Republicans are doing. https://t.co/vIc8COfsPL
Caring for our veterans and their families when they return home is a lifelong commitment our nation owes to those who served our country—and this week three bills became law that help us live up to that sacred obligation. 
https://t.co/kEjsK21Ar9
I know that this country can deliver for working families. We have before—and we will again.
Trickle-down economics has never worked. That’s why our infrastructure law is a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America. The only way this works is if blue-collar Americans do the rebuilding.

That's the only way it's ever worked and we're going to do it again. Mark my words.
Republicans would rather the bills at your kitchen table be higher so the taxes in big mansions can be lower. 

Let me tell you something: Nothing will be more expensive for American families than a NO vote on the Build Back Better plan.
In ten months, we've gone from an economy that was shut down due to the pandemic, to an economy that is leading the world in economic growth. Between record new small business creation to record new job creation, we’re rebuilding an economy where everyone comes along.
No parent should have to sit outside a fast food restaurant to use the internet so that their child can do their homework.

Our infrastructure law will expand access to affordable, high-speed internet, helping every household access what they need to work, learn, and live.
There’s still time to get your first shot, your booster shot, or to get your children vaccinated before Christmas. Get vaccinated.
We're going to fight the Omicron variant the way we’ve been fighting COVID-19 since the beginning—with scientific and knowledgeable actions and speed, not chaos and confusion.
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will ensure no parent will have to sit in a fast food parking lot just so their child can access the internet to do their homework.
My simple message to folks worried about the Omicron variant: Get vaccinated.
https://t.co/O61tmKGEW6
Since I was sworn in on January 20th, we’ve seen a record 5.6 million in job growth— with more jobs created at this point than ever before in American history. We’ve made enormous progress and we're on our way to building an economy that ensures no one is left behind. https://t.co/Lmbc7kbrrU
The Build Back Better Act extends the expanded Child Tax Credit, which has been a game changer for working families. It helped roughly 60 million children and helped cut child poverty in America by more than 40%.
Jill and I send our warmest wishes to everyone celebrating Hanukkah in the United States and around the world. May this festival of lights bring blessings upon you and your loved ones for happiness and health. Happy Hanukkah!

Thanks to our American Rescue Plan and a successful vaccine deployment, America continues to add jobs at a record pace. Our economy is on the move.

Action on climate change is a moral imperative. But it is also an economic imperative. We must build an equitable clean energy future that creates millions of good-paying jobs.

For children, learning and socializing with their classmates and teachers makes a world of difference from having to learn from home.

The bottom line: We’ve secured enough supply for every child in America to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. 
https://t.co/S35R34wwjw

Virginia, reproductive rights are under attack throughout the country and we must elect leaders who are absolutely committed to protecting those rights.

The Build Back Better Framework will set the U.S. on course to meet our climate targets, create millions of good-paying jobs, and grow our economy from the bottom up and the middle out.

It’s fully paid for by asking corporations and the wealthiest to reward work, not wealth.
Virginia, show up.

I ran for president for three reasons:
To restore the soul and decency of our country. 
To rebuild our economy from the bottom up and the middle out. 
And to help unite our country.

We’re on the right track—but there’s still work to be done.
Building back better starts in the states. Since flipping the legislature in 2019, Virginia Democrats have been a model of progress—including helping us vaccinate folks to beat the pandemic. To keep our progress, we must elect @TerryMcAuliffe and Democrats up and down the ballot. https://t.co/NsJiiPNzlv
For the better part of the 20th century, America led the world in investments in ourselves, in our people, in our country. But now, we risk losing our edge as a nation. Passing the Build Back Better Agenda will help us regain the momentum that we’ve lost.
Folks, Virginia has an important election coming up on November 2 and we need your help reaching out to voters across the state to get out the vote. Sign up today to join a phone bank: https://t.co/FGrVXHp748
A teacher shouldn’t pay a higher tax rate than a profitable company. It’s time we reward work in this country—not just wealth.
Passing the Build Back Better Agenda is about competitiveness versus complacency.
Opportunity versus decay.  
Leading the world or letting the world pass us by.

When workers and families have a better shot, America has a better shot.
The 21st century Jim Crow assault is real. It's unrelenting, and we're going to challenge it vigorously. https://t.co/jGkrvWB5Ev

With the expanded Child Tax Credit, working families are getting the relief they need thanks to the American Rescue Plan. 

This money is making a difference for countless Americans and lifting millions of kids out of poverty.
Today, another round of payments from the expanded Child Tax Credit will help millions of families across the country with payments of up to $300 per child. 

This is just the first step. Our Build Back Better Agenda will extend this benefit for years to come.
The evidence is clear: Vaccination requirements work. https://t.co/aODppNEa7F
More than 1 out of 3 eligible seniors have already received their COVID-19 booster.

Folks, it’s been a month since I laid out my plan to accelerate the path out of this pandemic. We’ve made real progress, but we still have a long way to go.

There’s no better way to beat this pandemic than to get the vast majority of Americans vaccinated. It’s as simple as that.
Virginia: Last year, the people voted and democracy prevailed. We have to do it again and elect @TerryMcAuliffe as governor.

Today is the last day to register to vote. Head to https://t.co/rqHXR7xuqW and make sure you're registered.
For the first time since March 2020, the unemployment rate is below 5%. We still have more work to do, but recovery is moving forward even in the face of a pandemic.
We have a plan. We have the tools. Let’s finish the job—get vaccinated.
https://t.co/b8jlTuDMTm
An average of 600,000 new jobs have been created every month since we took office. 

Jobs are up, wages are up, and unemployment is down. This progress is attributed to the hard work and resilience of the American people, who are battling through this pandemic.
Let’s set one thing straight: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal and the Build Back Better Agenda are not about left versus right.

They’re about leading the world or continuing to let the world pass us by.
Before the American Rescue Plan passed, the Congressional Budget Office projected that it would take until 2023 to get to a 4.8% unemployment rate.

We hit that rate in October of 2021.
Here's the deal. Vaccine requirements are already proving that they work.

More than 185 million Americans are now fully vaccinated and more than 75% of eligible Americans have gotten at least one shot. That’s real progress.
Let’s be clear: Vaccine requirements aren't about politics, they’re about saving lives.
https://t.co/LizrAytwGZ
We’re making real progress for the American people. https://t.co/CqNYb5ZFwk
Millions of American parents are feeling the squeeze, having a hard time doing their job, earning a paycheck, while taking care of their children or aging parents. My Build Back Better Agenda will change that.
When we give working families a break, we're not just raising their quality of life—we're putting parents in a position to earn a paycheck. That's what the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal and the Build Back Better Agenda are all about.
Teachers and firefighters shouldn’t pay a higher tax rate than millionaires and billionaires.

We have a path to usher in a new era of economic growth that benefits everybody, not just those at the top, with the Build Back Better Agenda and Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal.
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal and the Build Back Better Agenda will create good-paying jobs and lower costs for families. 

Together they will grow the economy for everybody.
This is the moment to make sure all of us—not just the wealthy few at the top—are dealt in and share the benefits of a growing economy. This is our opportunity to not just build back, but build back better for all Americans.
Our Build Back Better Agenda will strengthen our economy by lowering taxes on the working and middle class, and reducing the cost of child care, housing, and higher education.

We will grow our economy from the bottom up and the middle out.
As my friend, American hero Representative John Lewis, reminded us shortly before he passed, 'Democracy is not a state. It is an act.’ This National Voter Registration Day, and every day, we are committed to defending, strengthening, and expanding the sacred right to vote.
Last year, 55 of the largest corporations paid zero dollars in federal income taxes on over $40 billion of profits.

It’s time for big corporations to finally pay their fair share.
We have the power to build the country we hope to leave to our children and grandchildren—and it starts at the ballot box.

Millionaires and billionaires are paying a lower tax rate than teachers and firefighters. We’re going to restore fairness to the tax code, give working people a much-needed tax cut, and make the investments that will grow our economy for years to come.
Our Build Back Better Agenda will cut taxes for the middle class, lower costs for working families, create more jobs, and sustain economic growth for years to come. 

And the most important part? No one making under $400,000 will pay a penny more in taxes.
If you don’t qualify for the booster, or you got the Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccines: if you’re fully vaccinated, you’re highly protected from severe illness even if you get COVID-19. https://t.co/1FbMCy9san
Climate change is all around us. From hurricanes and unprecedented flooding to historic wildfires, we’ve seen its effects firsthand all summer. 

We have a chance to stop climate change’s worst effects, but we have to act right now. We must pass our Build Back Better Agenda.
We’ve made so much progress during the past eight months of this pandemic, and now we face a critical moment. We have the tools and we have the plan—we just have to finish the job together as one nation. 

Please, get vaccinated.
While typical working Americans pay their taxes, the top 1% evade an estimated $160 billion in taxes each year.
 
It’s wrong—and it’s past time the ultra-wealthy and corporations paid their fair share.
The majority of Americans who were fully vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine are now eligible to receive a booster shot six months after they've received their second shot. https://t.co/6vVAhppz8u
For too long, our economy has worked great for those at the top, while the hardworking people who built this country have been cut out of the deal. Our Build Back Better Agenda will deal working people back in.
Folks, we’re facing an urgent choice: do we keep an economy that serves the wealthiest and biggest corporations—or finally give middle class families a fair shot?

Our Build Back Better agenda is our moment to prove to the American people that their government works for them.
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal is a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America that will help make our historic economic recovery a historic long-term boom.
Our Build Back Better Agenda will bring down the everyday costs that have for years been taking a bigger and bigger bite out of middle-class families’ incomes: health care, prescription drug costs, child care, education, housing, or caring for an elderly relative or loved one.
We stand at an inflection point in history. The United States intends to work with partners and allies to answer these questions and help lead the world toward a more peaceful, prosperous future for all people. https://t.co/3JYwybRezw
As we pursue diplomacy across the board, the U.S. will champion the democratic values that go to the very heart of who we are as a nation and a people—freedom, equality, opportunity, and a belief in the universal rights of all people. 

It's stamped into our DNA as a nation.
For the first time in 20 years, the United States is not at war. We’ve turned the page.

All the unmatched strength, energy, commitment, will, and resources of our nation are now fully and squarely focused on what’s ahead of us, not what was behind. https://t.co/4n3HlIiUlY
As we recover from this crisis, we must put in place a long-term plan to increase opportunities with better jobs and higher wages; a plan that will lower the everyday costs that strain our budgets and our nation’s families.

Our Build Back Better Agenda will get it done.
The evidence is clear: climate change poses an existential threat. If we don't stay below 1.5°C of global temperature rise, we're in deep trouble.  

We need to build back better by investing in clean energy, cutting emissions, and fighting climate change head on.
This summer alone, over 100 million Americans and the communities they call home have been affected by extreme weather.  

We can’t just rebuild, we have to build back better. We have to invest in climate resilience to protect our communities and work to cut carbon emissions.
Our Build Back Better Agenda will invest in working families by cutting taxes, lowering prescription drug prices and health care costs, and reducing the cost of child care. 

We’ll build our economy from the bottom up and middle out.
Past presidents have cut taxes for the wealthy and biggest corporations with the promise of economic growth.

It doesn't work.

The ultra-wealthy and corporations must pay their fair share—which will lower costs for the middle class.
Our Build Back Better Agenda is a historic investment in middle-class families. It will be paid for by reforming the tax code to make sure the wealthiest Americans and largest corporations pay their fair share.

No one earning under $400,000 will pay a penny more in taxes.
Virtually all of the COVID deaths and hospitalizations are from unvaccinated people. Get your shot.
We can build an economy that gives working people a fair shot. 
We can restore some sanity and fairness to our tax code. 
We can make the investments that we know are long overdue in this nation. 

That's exactly what my Bipartisan Infrastructure Plan does.
Our Build Back Better agenda takes on the existential threat of climate change directly by investing in clean energy, creating good-paying, union jobs, and working to stop the climate crisis’s most disastrous impacts on working families.
Big corporations and the super wealthy have to start paying their fair share of taxes. It’s long overdue. 

I'm not out to punish anyone. All I'm asking is that you pay your fair share—just like middle-class folks do.
When big corporations and the wealthy pay their fair share, we are able to invest in America. https://t.co/b2U1BgSdjP
Republican governors in states like Texas and Florida are doing everything they can to undermine the public health requirements that keep people safe.

They're playing politics with the lives of their citizens, especially children. I refuse to give in to it.
This is our moment to prove to the American people that their government works for them, not just for the big corporations and those at the very top. https://t.co/Ie9keqGYqk
The Build Back Better Agenda will lower the costs of:
✅ Child care
✅ Higher education
✅ Prescription drugs
✅ Health care
✅ Housing

And we’ll do it by making the wealthiest and large corporations pay their fair share.
Congratulations Governor @GavinNewsom on defeating the recall. This vote is a resounding win for the approach that he and I share to beating the pandemic: strong vaccine requirements, steps to reopen schools safely, and plans to help those who get sick.
California, Election Day is today. On behalf of people all across America, don’t take anything for granted. If you want to vote in person, make sure you know where you’re going to vote. If you’ve already voted, make sure your family and friends are voting. Vote no on the recall. https://t.co/Y9DFAZej6S
California, vote to keep @GavinNewsom your governor. The rest of America is counting on you, and so am I. https://t.co/mYnR2isUjI
California, today is Election Day. We’re counting on you to vote NO on the recall to keep @GavinNewsom in office and California moving forward.

Polls are open until 8pm. Make your voice heard.
Tomorrow's Election Day—so I’m here with @GavinNewsom to ask Californians to vote no on the recall. Help protect the progress we’ve made. https://t.co/GDWCT1Z4zZ
Vaccines are free, safe, and convenient. https://t.co/mJS9AteS8o
Twenty years ago, nearly 3,000 lives were cut short by an unspeakable act of cowardice and hatred on 9/11. As a nation, we must never forget those we lost during one of the darkest moments in our history and the enduring pain of their families and loved ones.
Our new COVID-19 plan will reduce the number of unvaccinated Americans, decrease hospitalizations and deaths, allow our children to go to schools safely, and keep our economy strong by keeping businesses open. 

We will spare no effort in saving lives and beating this virus.
Our plan takes on the elected officials in states that are undermining the life-saving actions we need to take to defeat COVID-19. 

If these governors won’t help us beat the pandemic, we will get them out of the way. https://t.co/8XcibeNeV4
My first responsibility is to protect the American people and make sure we have vaccines for every American, including enough boosters. As soon as they're authorized, those eligible will be able to get a free booster right away in tens of thousands of sites across the country.
The Department of Labor is developing an emergency rule to require that all employers with 100 or more employees ensure their workforces are fully vaccinated or show a negative test at least once a week. https://t.co/Yn2kDf63FU
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal and the Build Back Better Agenda will:
✅Create millions of good-paying jobs rebuilding roads and bridges
✅Lower taxes for working families
✅Lower costs for working families, including child care, elder care, community college, pre-K, and more
The pandemic of the unvaccinated is a tragedy that is preventable. People are dying and will die from COVID-19 who don't have to. 

If you haven't gotten vaccinated, do it now. It could save your life and the lives of those you love.
Folks, the evidence is clear, climate change poses an existential threat to our lives and our economy. But we can stop it from getting worse. 

Our Build Back Better plan will make investments to fight the climate crisis, cut emissions, and make our infrastructure more resilient.
The middle class built America, and unions built the middle class.  

This Labor Day, we honor all the workers, and their enduring movement, that keep our economy moving and are the heart, soul, and spine of this nation. https://t.co/mzLEKfW7j8
We are now the only developed country in the world whose economy is bigger than it was before the pandemic. Our economic plan is working. https://t.co/Xj715N5rx7
The Supreme Court's overnight ruling is an unprecedented assault on constitutional rights and requires an immediate response.

We will launch a whole-of-government effort to respond, looking at what steps we can take to ensure that Texans have access to safe and legal abortions.
To everyone who is still in harm's way and for all those struggling to deal with the aftermath of the storms and fires, keep the faith. We’re going to stand with you for as long as it takes to recover and rebuild.
Texas law SB8 will significantly impair people’s access to the health care they need—particularly for communities of color and individuals with low incomes.

We are deeply committed to the constitutional right established in Roe v. Wade and will protect and defend that right.
I was not going to extend this forever war. https://t.co/QoDLRA4Hqr
There is nothing low-grade, low-risk, or low-cost about any war. It was time to end the war in Afghanistan. https://t.co/jAGbWnBzol
We're going to do everything that we can to provide safe evacuation for Americans, our Afghan allies, partners, and Afghans who might be targeted because of their association with the United States.
Thank you to @SpeakerPelosi and every Democrat who came together to advance our Build Back Better Agenda in the House. The House’s historic vote is a huge step forward in our work to restore America’s economy, rebuild our infrastructure, and invest in our shared future.
To the millions of Americans who have been waiting for full FDA approval—go get your COVID-19 shot now. https://t.co/393WzbJ6om
The United States stands by the commitment we’ve made to evacuate people—and this includes vulnerable Afghans, such as women leaders and journalists. https://t.co/kfjfyKmBcM
Once screened and cleared, we will welcome Afghans who helped us in the war effort to their new home in the United States of America. 

Because that's who we are. That's what America is.
To those in Henri’s path: Don't forget that you may need to seek shelter while we’re still battling COVID-19 and the Delta variant. So wear a mask and try to observe social distancing.

And to everyone across the country, don't get caught by the next storm. Get vaccinated now.
Human rights must be the center of our foreign policy, not the periphery. But the way to do it is not through endless military deployments. https://t.co/w2jMtgzisE
The answer is clear: We cannot continue to repeat the mistakes of the past. https://t.co/AA9Fc6ZFXi
Four presidents have presided over an American troop presence in Afghanistan—two Republicans and two Democrats. We will not pass this war onto a fifth. https://t.co/d5kIcw27h8
Our economy is coming back—but there’s more work to be done. We have to beat this virus. Get vaccinated.
While we will have ups and downs along the way, it’s clear: our economic plan is working, it produces results, and it’s moving our country forward. https://t.co/uAIcTZowyH
Today, about 40 million families will receive their second monthly payment as part of the expanded Child Tax Credit.

This money is a game changer─and for some, it’s a lifesaver. https://t.co/v7BJtVo8eJ
Gov. @GavinNewsom is leading California through unprecedented crises—he's a key partner in fighting the pandemic and helping build our economy back better. To keep him on the job, registered voters should vote no on the recall election by 9/14 and keep California moving forward.
There are no Republican bridges or Democratic roads. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal is a win for all Americans. https://t.co/fcvJV3zwd8
What a year it’s been. With @KamalaHarris, we are building our country back better than ever before. https://t.co/FXQeOcbBqg
After years and years of “infrastructure week,” we're on the cusp of a historic, bipartisan infrastructure decade that will transform America.

We’ve made historic economic progress and created more jobs than any administration has done in the first six months of being in office.
 
Now, we have a chance to turn this great movement into an economy that works for all Americans—not just the wealthy.
Workers shouldn’t just compete for jobs. Jobs should compete for workers. https://t.co/2o4a7Bjd9c

Over 300 million shots administered.

More than three million jobs added to the U.S. economy.

We’ve come a long way. But this is just the beginning.
Help us mark our independence from this virus—get vaccinated.
The science is clear: The best way to protect yourself against the virus and its variants is to be fully vaccinated. 

If you have not been vaccinated, get your COVID-19 shot as soon as possible. Now is not the time to let our guard down.
.@TheDemocrats are mobilizing volunteers and organizers, investing in state parties, fighting to protect voting rights, and more. If you can, consider chipping in to keep building the party infrastructure we need to win—from the school board to the Senate.
https://t.co/JPmx9sPyde
We, the people, are coming back together. https://t.co/xELkAnPq6z
It took a herculean effort across the globe—including the ingenuity of scientists, building on decades of research—to develop a vaccine. As a result, deaths from COVID-19 are plummeting. Our economy is rebounding. And millions of Americans are getting back to living their lives. https://t.co/lqwfh0Nj21
It’s a simple proposition: Who do you love? https://t.co/jDUjB9J6pL
Together, we are going to build an economy that rewards work—not just wealth. An economy that works for the backbone of this country: the people who get up every single day to work hard to provide for their families, who are just looking for a little bit of breathing room.
To honor the true meaning of Juneteenth, we have to continue toward that promise of equality for all. https://t.co/tu6m038Y8T
It’s a big deal that the Affordable Care Act is here to stay. Reminder: You can sign up for health care at https://t.co/3CYKhP8ZoR—help us spread the word.
We're on the right track. The American Rescue Plan laid a strong foundation for a new economy that brings everybody along, but it's just the first step. We must pass the American Jobs Plan to build an economy that works for everyone.
We’re seeing a coordinated attack on voting rights in this country. It’s Jim Crow in the 21st century, and it must end.

Congress must enact legislation to make it easier for all eligible Americans to access the ballot box and prevent attacks on the sacred right to vote.
Democracy thrives when the infrastructure of democracy is strong; when people have the right to vote freely, fairly, and conveniently; when a free and independent press pursues the truth; when the law applies equally to everyone, regardless of who they are or what they look like.
The pandemic exposed just how badly we need to invest in the foundation of our country, and in the working people of our country. That's why we proposed the American Jobs Plan—we need to make generational investments today to succeed tomorrow.
The COVID-19 vaccine is free, but lack of access to child care can be a barrier. That’s why four of our nation’s largest child care providers are offering free care for parents and caregivers getting vaccinated from now until July 4: https://t.co/nAUPgjxTWI
COVID-19 vaccines are free. Get vaccinated, folks.
LGBTQ+ rights are human rights. As we celebrate this month, we won’t rest until full equality for LGBTQ+ Americans is finally achieved and codified into law. The Senate must pass the Equality Act.
We said from the very beginning: there’s no chance for our economy to come back unless we beat the pandemic. And now, after more than a year of darkness, we’re emerging into the light.

Get your vaccine and do your part to help get our country back on track.
The United States is the only industrialized country in the world with no national paid family leave policy. It’s a disgrace. 

We must pass the American Families Plan.
In the competition for the 21st century, the future will be built right here in America.
We’re counting on you to get vaccinated: https://t.co/EwdQ2dFHwG.
After decades of disinvestment, our roads, bridges, and water systems are crumbling.

We must pass the American Jobs Plan. Together, we will rebuild our country’s infrastructure and create millions of good-paying union jobs in the process.
Now is the time to build on the foundation we've laid. Because while the progress we’ve made is undeniable, it is not assured. That's why we need the American Jobs Plan and the American Families Plan—let's make those investments today to be able to continue to succeed tomorrow.

https://t.co/XfbPPFvKr8
Before we took office, the economy added back 60,000 jobs per month. It’s now adding back 500,000 jobs per month.

In fact, we've created 1.5 million jobs—more jobs than have ever been created in the first three months of any president in our nation's history.
To put it simply, America's coming back. https://t.co/SYN7NZkH91
This is our moment to rebuild an economy from the bottom up and the middle out—not trickle down.

This is our moment to rebuild an economy that rewards work, not just wealth.

This is our moment to rebuild an economy that works for the backbone of this country.

Across the country, we have failed to properly invest in infrastructure for half a century. The American Jobs Plan will get millions of Americans good-paying union jobs repairing our country’s crumbling infrastructure.

It’s a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America.
After meeting with experts and scientists, our administration has set an ambitious goal of having 70% of the U.S. adult population receive at least one dose of vaccine by July 4. 

It’s a big goal, but we are already doing a remarkable job—together, we’ll get through this.
The American Rescue Plan is helping get us out of this crisis and back on track—but we can’t stop now. 

We must pass the American Jobs Plan to deliver millions of good-paying jobs.

The American Jobs Plan is the largest American jobs investment since World War II.
Under the American Jobs Plan, 100% of our nation’s lead pipes and service lines will be replaced—so every child in America can turn on the faucet or fountain and drink clean water. 

We cannot delay another minute.
Wall Street didn’t build this country—the great American middle class did. This time, when we rebuild the middle class under the American Jobs Plan, we’re bringing everyone along.
Delivering for the American people is what the American Rescue Plan was about. It’s what the American Jobs Plan is about.

We can do this.
We have to do this.
We will do this.
The American Jobs Plan is a once-in-a-generation investment in America. It will:
✅Modernize 20,000 miles of highways, roads, and main streets
✅Repair 10,000 bridges desperately in need of upgrades 
✅Replace 100% of our nation’s lead pipes and service lines
Millions of Americans lost their jobs last year.

Here’s the truth: We all do better when we all do well. It’s time to build our economy from the bottom up—and the middle out—not the top down.
It matters whether you continue to wear a mask.  
It matters whether you continue to socially distance.  
It matters whether you wash your hands.  

It all matters and can help save lives.
The American Rescue Plan means a $7,000 check for a single mom of four. It means more support to safely and quickly reopen schools. It means setting up additional vaccination sites to help America get back to normal. 

What does the American Rescue Plan mean to you?
85% of American households will get direct checks from the American Rescue Plan.

For so many Americans, that means they can pay the rent. That means they can put food on the table.  

Share below what the American Rescue Plan will do for you.
A campaign for everyone who’s been knocked down or counted out.

A campaign that brought Americans together of every race, ethnicity, gender, economic station, and party.

A year ago, the people of South Carolina lifted that campaign on their shoulders.

As the National Day of Service comes to a close, we’re celebrating the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. with an evening full of entertainers and inspiring speakers. Tune in for “United We Serve.” https://t.co/hqWmdbXDWb
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s words remind us that darkness cannot drive out darkness and hate cannot drive out hate — only light and love can. As we seek to overcome this season of darkness in America, let us choose love and light and begin to heal — together. #MLKDay
Our Administration will lead with science and scientists — with a CDC and NIH that are free from political influence, a Surgeon General who is independent and speaks directly to the people, and an FDA whose decisions are based on science and science alone.
I know @harrisonjaime and the new DNC team are ready to strengthen our party’s infrastructure and elect Democrats across the country — but they need your help to do it.

If you’re able, chip in to support them by donating to the DNC today: https://t.co/GMCVuvPrYT https://t.co/bCBmAH8MCt
Service is a fitting way to start to heal, unite, and rebuild this country we love.

I hope you’ll join us in honoring the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. by participating in the National Day of Service: https://t.co/H4pDdtXc3V https://t.co/ecHlPK7PAO
I know masks have become a partisan issue — but it’s a patriotic act. Experts say wearing a mask from now until April will save more than 50,000 lives.
Across the country, approximately 14 million Americans have fallen behind on rent and many may soon be at risk of eviction.

We need to act now. That’s why next week, I’ll extend nationwide restrictions on evictions and foreclosures. https://t.co/kUxpcgOzRe
The first @BidenInaugural event is here. Tune in as we celebrate America, reflect and honor our history, and highlight the incredible diversity of the nation. https://t.co/6iIPivVt5N
To get as many people vaccinated as quickly as possible, we need more clinics across the nation. That’s why my administration will harness the full resources of the federal government to establish thousands of community vaccination centers. https://t.co/c551gKJZwa
Science will be at the forefront of my administration — and this group will ensure everything we do is grounded in science, facts, and the truth. Tune in as I introduce members of my science team. https://t.co/ZEhKL5k59t
Getting America vaccinated will be one of the most challenging operational efforts ever undertaken. But you have my word that we will manage the hell out of this operation. https://t.co/EtFTz9c3Lf
We not only have an economic imperative to act now, we have a moral obligation. 
 
In this pandemic, in America, we cannot let people go hungry. We cannot let people get evicted. We cannot watch nurses and educators lose their jobs.

We must act.
Science will always be at the forefront of my administration — and these world-renowned scientists will ensure everything we do is grounded in science, facts, and the truth. https://t.co/fEbgDMkTDZ
My administration will move Heaven and Earth to:

- Allow more people to get vaccinated
- Create more places for them to get vaccinated
- Mobilize more medical teams to get shots in arms
- Increase vaccine supply and get it out the door as soon as possible
To Pilar, and the countless other small business owners across the country, know that help is on the way. https://t.co/4mKPjN6rgx
Direct cash payments.
Extended unemployment.
Rent relief. 
Food assistance. 
Aid to small businesses.
Keeping essential frontline workers on the job.

Those are the key elements of my American Rescue Plan.
We have no time to waste when it comes to getting this virus under control and building our economy back better. Tune in as I announce my American Rescue Plan. https://t.co/4YAg0nhJMn
We need to tackle the public health and economic crises we’re facing head-on. That’s why today, I’m announcing my American Rescue Plan. Together we’ll change the course of the pandemic, build a bridge toward economic recovery, and invest in racial justice. https://t.co/UzGFZY7Jhp
We’re in the teeth of this crisis, and we need to take immediate action to get the virus under control. That’s why tomorrow, I’ll be laying out my vaccination and economic rescue package to beat COVID-19 and build back better. https://t.co/YRzJ5nlkDm
Today, in a bipartisan vote, the House voted to impeach and hold President Trump accountable. Now, the process continues to the Senate—and I hope they’ll deal with their Constitutional responsibilities on impeachment while also working on the other urgent business of this nation.
Ambassador Samantha Power is a world-renowned voice of conscience and moral clarity—challenging and rallying the international community to stand up for the dignity and humanity of all people. As USAID Administrator, she'll be a powerful force for principled American engagement. https://t.co/jwseGEsb8c
My number one priority is getting people vaccinated as quickly as we can to get our country back on track. https://t.co/JLY1DntIlR
It’s long past time to raise the minimum wage, so hardworking people earn at least $15 an hour. 
 
I hope that Democratic control of the House and Senate will ensure prompt action to get it done.
I urge every American to:

- Wear a mask
- Stay socially distanced
- Avoid large indoor gatherings

We can save countless lives if we step up together.
Getting America vaccinated will be one of the greatest operational challenges we’ve ever faced, but my administration will spare no effort to get it done.

We’re going to ensure the vaccine is distributed quickly, equitably, and free of charge to every American.
Folks, I just received the second dose of my COVID-19 vaccine — and just like the first dose, it was safe, quick, and painless. 

I urge everyone to get vaccinated once it’s your turn. Because only together can we save lives and beat this virus. https://t.co/w1m8gEh2iL
I’m asking Ambassador Bill Burns to lead the Central Intelligence Agency because he’s dealt with many of the thorniest global challenges we face. As a legendary career diplomat, he approached complex issues with honesty, integrity and skill. That’s exactly how he’ll lead the CIA. https://t.co/ypnuH016BV
$600 is simply not enough when you have to choose between paying rent or putting food on the table.
 
We need $2,000 stimulus checks.
I am proud that we have finished naming the members of our Cabinet.
 
It’s a Cabinet that looks like America and taps into the full range of talents we have in our nation. https://t.co/DTX53k7sUx
In 10 days, we move forward and rebuild — together.
The bottom line is we need to provide immediate relief for working families and businesses. Now. https://t.co/syaHTaX3O4
From the most inequitable economic and jobs crisis in modern history, my jobs team will help us build back better with an economy that works for all Americans. Let’s get to work. https://t.co/hx7cyOHF87
My administration will get right to work distributing emergency aid swiftly and equitably. Our focus will be on the small businesses on Main Street — not those that are wealthy and well-connected. https://t.co/FlD8voUpcP
.@GabbyGiffords — Your perseverance and immeasurable courage continue to inspire me and millions of others. I pledge to continue to work with you — and with survivors, families, and advocates across the country — to defeat the NRA and end our epidemic of gun violence. https://t.co/zN5J5YjXUM
Ten years ago today, in Tucson, Arizona, six innocent lives were taken away by a senseless and brutal act of violence. Jill and I remember those we lost and everyone whose lives were irreversibly changed that day — including my friend Congresswoman @GabbyGiffords.
We need to build a new American economy where everyone enjoys a fair return for their work and an equal chance to get ahead. Tune in as I introduce members of the team that will get it done. https://t.co/PAOu57i9j5
We need to restore the honor, the integrity, and the independence of the Department of Justice in this nation — and this is the group that will get it done. https://t.co/Yfuys8i73V
I’m proud to nominate Judge Merrick Garland for Attorney General of the United States. https://t.co/xBR5PAN2wH
For the past four years, President Trump has unleashed an all-out assault on the institutions of our democracy.

Yesterday was but the culmination of that unrelenting attack. https://t.co/Mcli7mzENu
This team shares my belief that the middle class built this country and that unions built the middle class.

They will help us emerge from the most inequitable economic crisis in modern history by building an economy where every American is in on the deal. https://t.co/iorqb5Dxpj
No one can tell me that if it had been a group of Black Lives Matter protestors yesterday that they wouldn’t have been treated very differently than the mob that stormed the Capitol. 

We all know that’s true — and it’s unacceptable.
Merrick Garland will serve as the Attorney General of the United States — not as my personal lawyer.
What we witnessed yesterday was not dissent — it was disorder. 

They weren’t protestors — they were rioters, insurrectionists, and domestic terrorists.

I wish we could say we couldn’t see it coming, but that isn’t true. We could.
It’s time for a Department of Justice that serves the interests of the people — not a presidency. Tune in as I introduce key nominees to lead the Department. https://t.co/8eIm9NvQS8
Our nominees for the Justice Department will restore the independence of the Department, so it serves the interests of the people—not a presidency. They’ll rebuild public trust in the rule of law and work to ensure a more fair and equitable justice system. https://t.co/MSCRAwsmaH
Today is a reminder, a painful one, that democracy is fragile. To preserve it requires people of good will, leaders with the courage to stand up, who are devoted not to pursuit of power and personal interest at any cost, but to the common good.
Through war and strife, America has endured much. And we will endure here and prevail now. https://t.co/OvNOV0ogWG
Our way is plain: It is the way of democracy — of lawfulness, and of respect — respect for each other, and for our nation.
America is so much better than what we’re seeing today.
I call on President Trump to go on national television now to fulfill his oath and defend the Constitution by demanding an end to this siege.
Let me be very clear: the scenes of chaos at the Capitol do not represent who we are. What we are seeing is a small number of extremists dedicated to lawlessness. This is not dissent, it's disorder. It borders on sedition, and it must end. Now.
I called Reverend Warnock and Jon Ossoff this morning to congratulate them on their hard-fought campaigns. Georgia voters delivered a resounding message yesterday: they want action on the crises we face and they want it right now. Together, we'll get it done. https://t.co/TPBEbgOwzH
Stay in line, Georgia. If you’re in line at your polling place by 7 PM, you can vote.
Georgia voters: If you’re voting in the county where you’re registered, you’re entitled to ask for a provisional ballot if you’re told you aren’t on the voter rolls. Don’t leave without voting.

If you have questions, call the Voter Protection Hotline: 888-730-5816
Georgia — If you elect @ReverendWarnock and @Ossoff, we can break the gridlock that has gripped Washington.

Go vote, Georgia!

https://t.co/RIJ1L4B5o9
I’m asking you to give everything you’ve got for one more day — because that one day can change America.

https://t.co/RIJ1L4B5o9 https://t.co/6RvV9Ffx04
In America, politicians can’t assert, take, or seize power.

It has to be given by the American people.

We can’t ever give that up. The will of the people must always prevail.
The debate over $2,000 isn’t some abstract debate in Washington. It’s about real lives.

Hardworking Americans need help, and they need it now.

Georgia — you have the power to make it happen. Vote. https://t.co/yFBBk1YAEm
With just one day to go until the Georgia Senate runoffs, I’m in Atlanta to get out the vote. Tune in. https://t.co/I4MBUj0g3o
One day left, folks. I’m on my way to Georgia to help send @ReverendWarnock and @Ossoff to the Senate. See you soon, Atlanta!
Georgia — If you haven’t returned your absentee ballot yet, drop it off at a drop box in your county today.

If you’re voting in-person tomorrow, make your plan today.

Let’s flip the Senate: https://t.co/RIJ1L4juwB
The Senate swearing-in ceremony was always one of my favorite parts of the job as Vice President. Congratulations to the newly minted members of the 117th Congress. I look forward to working alongside you to get this virus under control and build back better.
With just two days to go until the Georgia Senate runoffs, @KamalaHarris is in Savannah firing up folks to get out and vote. Tune in. https://t.co/3F4wMyotcO
Here’s my promise to you: I’ll be a president for all Americans. Whether you voted for me or not, I’ll wake up every single morning and work to make your life better.
Floyd Little and I were students at Syracuse University together. And over the years, I got to know the man behind the number. He was full of character, decency, and integrity. I will miss my friend. The entire Biden family sends our love to DeBorah and the Little family. https://t.co/OsmyvPBFvu
Mask up, folks.
It’s the final weekend before the Georgia Senate runoffs, which means we have just a few days left to do everything we can to flip the Senate. If you have a few minutes, sign up to make calls and let’s get to work: https://t.co/uR93pEtK1X
Let me be clear: The Biden-Harris Administration will spare no effort to make sure people are getting vaccinated. https://t.co/FfppocXufa

In 2021, we’re going to build a brighter future. https://t.co/YjzT7aw5zQ
The challenges we face as a nation will not disappear overnight, but as we look forward to the start of a new year, I’m filled with fresh hope about the possibilities of better days to come. 

After a year of pain and loss, let us unite, heal, and rebuild in 2021.
We have less than one week to do everything in our power to help Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock win their Senate runoff elections in Georgia. These races will not only determine the fate of the Senate but the future of our country. Chip in today: https://t.co/EByC4gktYT
Georgia — Today is your last chance to vote early ahead of next week’s Senate runoffs. 

Confirm your polling location and go vote: https://t.co/RIJ1L4juwB
The next few weeks and months are going to be a very tough period for our nation — maybe the toughest of the whole pandemic. 

But we are going to get through it. Brighter days are coming, but it’s going to take all the grit and determination we have as Americans to do it.
With just over 20 days until Inauguration Day, there’s never been a better time to stock up on @BidenInaugural gear. Head to https://t.co/j1ZK7kyMj6 to find everything you need.
We can save 60,000-100,000 lives in the weeks and months ahead if we step up together.

Wear a mask. Stay socially distanced. Avoid large indoor gatherings.

Each of us has a duty to do what we can to protect ourselves, our families, and our fellow Americans.
We’re going to make sure vaccines are free of charge.

And we’re going to ensure they are distributed equitably, so every person who wants a vaccine can get one — no matter the color of their skin or where they live. https://t.co/uLQfxS1PM0
After ten months of the pandemic, we still don’t have enough testing. It’s a travesty.

We need to scale up testing so anyone who needs one can get one.
Once in office, I will be asking the American people to wear a mask for the first 100 days of my administration. Not as a political statement, but as a patriotic duty. https://t.co/0Uayw4sAs7

Meeting the most daunting threats of our time requires American engagement and leadership — but none of them can be solved alone. https://t.co/cfCqvFGEbZ
This year, we’ve painfully learned the cost of being unprepared for a pandemic.
 
If we aren’t investing with our partners around the world, we’re undermining our ability to defeat COVID-19 and leaving ourselves vulnerable to the next deadly epidemic.
Right now, my team isn’t getting all the information that we need from the outgoing administration in key national security areas. 

It’s nothing short of irresponsible. https://t.co/T67NbgSFLl

From COVID-19 and the economy to climate change and racial justice — our nation is facing four historic crises at once. And come January, there will be no time to waste. That’s why my team and I are hard at work preparing to take action on day one.
To all the health care workers on the front lines of this fight — thank you. You are true heroes.
After a year of pain and loss, it’s time to unite, heal, and rebuild.
Jill and I send our heartfelt wishes to everyone celebrating Kwanzaa. We hope these days of reflection on the seven principles and the rich heritage of African-American culture bring peace, unity, and joy.
From our family to yours, Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays. https://t.co/NzVEFFfrG1
We take holiday traditions very seriously in the Biden family. https://t.co/I7L6sGkkHN
I know how hard it is to forego holiday traditions — but it is so very important. Please wear masks, limit the size of any groups, and refrain from traveling. We have to stay apart just a little longer.
To Linda — and everyone out there who’s hurting or struggling — keep the faith. https://t.co/pXDHmzvYQ8
No matter how you’re celebrating this year, Champ and Major wish you a Merry Christmas. https://t.co/SrZBT4vmpP
Every student must be equipped to thrive in the economy of the future. Every educator needs resources to do their jobs with dignity and success. And every school needs support to reopen safely.

We can achieve this with Dr. Miguel Cardona leading our Department of Education. https://t.co/vfYQhnPEEA
In the 21st century, twelve years of school isn’t enough. That’s why under the Biden-Harris plan, community college will be free — and public colleges and universities will be tuition-free for families earning less than $125,000 a year.
We need to make sure every child in this nation has access to a good education — regardless of zip code or disability. https://t.co/YGp4rB1IjA
It’s long past time we pay teachers what they deserve.  

The work they do is of extreme national importance — and their salaries should reflect that.
Here’s the simple truth: Our darkest days in this battle against COVID are ahead of us — not behind us.  
 
We need to prepare ourselves and steel our spines. https://t.co/TSn5hdpzGj
With Dr. Miguel Cardona leading the way, we’re going to ensure every student in this country receives a high-quality education. Tune in as I nominate him to be our next Secretary of Education. https://t.co/6NpNDLBkCg
This cybersecurity attack happened on Donald Trump’s watch. But rest assured that even if he does not take it seriously, I will. https://t.co/cujska0v7m
Yesterday, in an effort to instill confidence in the vaccine, I had my shot administered in public. 
 
I have absolute confidence in the vaccine and look forward to the second shot. https://t.co/5jeBLMY4z2
An educator will lead our Department of Education.

I am proud to nominate Dr. Miguel Cardona to ensure our teachers are taken care of, and our children have an opportunity to thrive.
In the first 100 days of my administration, we will:

- Ask all Americans to mask up
- Administer 100 million vaccine shots
- Get most schools back open

We’re going to contain the virus and get back to our lives.
Tune in as I deliver remarks ahead of the holiday. https://t.co/NScn1mPn0P

I applaud this relief package, but our work is far from over. Starting in the new year, Congress will need to immediately get to work on support for our COVID-19 plan.

My message to everyone out there struggling right now: help is on the way. https://t.co/ktET5loEnm
Today, I received the COVID-19 vaccine.

To the scientists and researchers who worked tirelessly to make this possible — thank you. We owe you an awful lot.

And to the American people — know there is nothing to worry about. When the vaccine is available, I urge you to take it. https://t.co/QBtB620i2V
I know you're probably tired of hearing about politics after this year. But with just 15 days left until the Georgia Senate runoffs, we can't take our foot off the gas.

Let me be clear: The United States of America has always set an example for the world for the peaceful transition of power — and we will do so again.
We have no time to waste to confront the climate crisis, protect our air and water, and deliver justice to communities that have long shouldered the burdens of environmental harms.

Together, on behalf of all Americans, this team will meet this moment with the urgency it demands. https://t.co/ob58nUVIJm

Georgia — Make your plan to vote early today: https://t.co/RIJ1L4juwB https://t.co/G9lRQQawH7
Millions of people are out of work. Small businesses are closing. People are struggling to pay their bills, stay in their homes, and put food on the table.

Congress needs to pass a relief package immediately.
When I think of climate change, I think about jobs. Good-paying, union jobs that put Americans to work, make our air cleaner, and rebuild America’s crumbling infrastructure.
In this battle for the soul of America, democracy prevailed.
.@KamalaHarris and I are building a historic Cabinet.

A Cabinet that looks like America and taps into the best of this nation. https://t.co/RiVfPB9NpJ

As tough as this moment is in the country, as dark as these days of winter seem, I am still more optimistic about the future of this country than I have been my whole career.

There is nothing beyond America’s capacity if we work together.

There have been plenty of thoughts and prayers in the years since, but we know that is not enough. Together, with millions of our fellow Americans, we will fight to end this scourge on our society and enact common-sense reforms that will save countless lives.
I think about how that day eight years ago was the saddest day we had in the White House. Twenty first-graders. Their six educators. And I think about the time we have spent with each other grieving since then. I remain in awe as so many of you turned pain into purpose.
To the families, loved ones, and broken and healing hearts of Sandy Hook, I know. No matter how long it’s been, every time you talk about it, you relive it as though you just heard the news. Eight years later, I know the pain never fully heals. https://t.co/qzeKBestac

We’re in the teeth of the COVID-19 crisis right now, and this nation needs presidential leadership.

Leadership that is willing to model the steps we all should be taking in our own lives.
For your family, neighbors, and country — wear a mask. https://t.co/tTYxY6D0YA
We may be physically apart during these difficult times, but you’re not alone. Take a few minutes today to reach out to friends and family. We’ll get through this, together. https://t.co/VMrXiBQzsH
Congress needs to act now on a COVID relief package. The American people can’t wait. https://t.co/NCZADDAKDd
Wear a mask. 
 
It's the easiest thing you can do to reduce COVID cases, hospitalizations, and deaths.

It's not a political statement — it's a patriotic act.
My first 100 days won’t end COVID-19, but we can slow the spread, save lives, and get back to our lives with our loved ones. https://t.co/nz2YkjhQZa
Under a Biden-Harris Administration, we will rejoin the Paris Agreement on day one and lead the world in the fight against climate change. https://t.co/dHSsXRk35h
Five years ago today, the world gathered to adopt the Paris Agreement on climate change.

And in 39 days, the United States is going to rejoin it.

We’re going to rally the world to push our progress further and faster and tackle the climate crisis head-on.
This team will meet the unique and challenging moment we’re facing as a nation. They bring deep experience, bold new thinking, and they know how government can — and should — work.

Together, we’re going to build back better for all Americans. https://t.co/LxRLvRKCFD
Beating COVID-19 will take everyone doing their part.

Wear a mask. Social distance. Limit travel over the holidays. 

We can end this, together.
From Housing and Urban Development to Veterans Affairs — this team is where the rubber meets the road, and they’re ready to help the American people build back better. Tune in as I introduce them. https://t.co/AE4u0OYubE

I have worked closely with Secretary-designate Lloyd Austin. He is the definition of duty, honor, and country. I know that under his leadership, the Department of Defense will advance the security of the American people in ways that always honor our highest values and ideals. https://t.co/OSU6b9Ip0c
Secretary-designate Lloyd Austin is feared by our adversaries, respected by our allies, and beloved by the men and women of America’s armed forces.

On day one, I’ll sign an executive order to require masks everywhere I can. https://t.co/ixUbTwHhPk
Out of our collective pain, we will find our collective purpose: to control the pandemic, to save lives, and to heal as a nation.
Dr. Fauci is trusted, a truth teller, and a patriot. I’m grateful he’ll be a key member of my COVID team as we work to get this virus under control. https://t.co/kFpeuNbXbc
Today, I'm announcing key COVID-19 priorities for the first 100 days of my administration:

- Everyone wears a mask
- 100 million vaccinations
- Reopen the majority of schools

With these steps, we can change the course of the disease and change life in America for the better.
I know General Austin. I trust him. Because I know how he reacts under pressure.

When ISIS emerged as a terrorist threat, President Obama and I turned to General Austin in the Situation Room and he led us through.

Now, I turn to him again as Secretary of Defense. https://t.co/p65aVc4Nt5
In the many hours we've spent together in the Situation Room and with our troops—I've witnessed General Austin's character. 

He shares my belief that we are strongest when we lead not only by the example of our power, but by the power of our example. https://t.co/7TB9X12sjL
I need a team that’s ready on day one to contain the pandemic and ensure everyone has access to quality, affordable health care. This is that team. Tune in as I introduce them for the first time. https://t.co/FhbbTa7xEo

Paul Sarbanes and I served together on the Foreign Relations Committee for 30 years. There was no one sharper, more committed, or with firmer principles. And he, too, returned to his family nearly every night. They meant the world to him.

Rest In Peace, Paul. https://t.co/tzekdNb74b
Today, we remember those we lost at Pearl Harbor 79 years ago — and we salute those who answered duty’s call with strength and courage. Our nation owes an incredible debt to those who have served and must ensure they and their families receive the care they’ve earned.
Dr. Fauci isn't just one of our foremost experts on combating viruses—he is a good man and a tireless public servant. He has served six presidents and led us through some of our toughest challenges.

Our administration, and our country, will be stronger because of his guidance.
Georgia — Today is your last day to register to vote in the January runoff.

I promise you this: I will spare no effort — or commitment — to end this pandemic.
The dreams of too many Americans have been deferred for too long. 

We must make the promise of this nation real for everybody — no matter their race, identity, ethnicity, or faith.
With COVID-19 cases rising across the nation, we need to ramp up our production of personal protective equipment. We have to ensure our brave health care workers have everything they need to safely battle this virus.
I know times are tough, the challenges are daunting, but I know we can do this.

We can create an economic recovery for all. We can move from crisis to recovery to resurgence.

This is the United States of America. We’ve done it before — and we will do it again.
My dad used to say, “Joey, I don’t expect the government to solve my problems. But I expect it to understand my problems.”

Folks out there aren’t looking for a handout — they just need help. They’re in trouble through no fault of their own, and they need us to understand. https://t.co/V0OCfFXVKT
If Congress and President Trump fail to act by the end of December:

- 12 million Americans will lose unemployment benefits
- Emergency paid leave will end
- The moratorium on evictions will expire 

The situation is urgent. Americans need help and they need it now.
Our country is in the middle of a dramatic spike in COVID-19 cases. Please wear a mask, keep social distancing, and limit the size of any groups. It’s our patriotic duty as Americans.
With less than 50 days until Inauguration Day, now is the perfect time to stock up on gear to celebrate. Head to https://t.co/j1ZK7kQnaE to find everything you need.

On this International Day of People with Disabilities and every day of the Biden-Harris administration, we'll be fully committed to dignity, equity, and civil rights for all people with disabilities. They'll always have a voice and be at the table for the critical work ahead.
Once a vaccine is ready and approved, @KamalaHarris and I are going to ensure it’s distributed equitably, efficiently, and free of charge to every American.
Yesterday, I spent the afternoon hearing from workers and small business owners on the economic impact COVID-19 has had on their lives. Americans are hurting — it’s why as president, I’ll work to provide immediate relief and get our economy back on track. https://t.co/Cyw0DhJCpP

A first-rate team that will get us through the economic crisis and help build our economy back better than before. https://t.co/eSUV6ibiZ1
This World AIDS Day, Jill and I join with communities around the globe to remember those we've lost. Because of the hard work of advocates, activists, and frontline workers, an AIDS-free generation is within reach — and my administration will work tirelessly to make it a reality.

My administration won’t just build back to the way things were before — we’re going to build back better. We’re going to ensure every single American has a fair shot to get ahead.
We have no time to lose to address the economic crisis we face and build our economy back better.

This team will be ready on Day One to pull every lever of government to help those hardest hit by COVID-19 and right the structural inequalities in our economy. https://t.co/cQ2MqV0mIW
It’s time to put away the harsh rhetoric, lower the temperature, and listen to each other again.

To make progress, we must stop treating our opponents as our enemy. 

We are not enemies. We are Americans.
Let me be clear: Wearing a mask is not about making your life less comfortable or taking something away. It’s to give something back to all of us — a normal life.
We have to come together as a nation and unite around our shared goal: defeating this virus.
I’ve always believed we can define America in one word: Possibilities.

We’re going to build an America where everyone has the opportunity to go as far as their dreams and God-given ability will take them.
Small businesses are the backbone of communities across the country — and amid the pandemic, they need our help more than ever. Today, and every day, support your neighbors and strengthen your community by shopping small. #SmallBusinessSaturday https://t.co/MG9fwMi2sQ
This is our moment — ours together — to write a newer, bolder, more compassionate chapter in the life of our nation.
This is the moment where we need to steel our spines, redouble our efforts, and recommit ourselves to the fight against COVID-19.

Let’s remember: We are all in this together. https://t.co/eliNEe7XCL
This Native American Heritage Day, we give thanks to our Indigenous communities and their ancestors. As we celebrate their rich heritage and contributions, let’s commit to writing a new future together — one built on a strong partnership and filled with opportunity for all.
Millions of front line workers — like the firefighters and nurses I called today — worked away from their families on Thanksgiving. Our nation is grateful to all of you. https://t.co/VhHePAEzvx

America is not going to lose the war against this virus. 

We’ll get our lives back. Life is going to return to normal. I promise.

Today, on the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, I reaffirm my commitment to ending this epidemic. A Biden-Harris administration will take bold action here at home and rejoin global efforts to confront gender-based violence in all its forms.
As many as 1 in 3 women is the victim of gender-based violence at some point in her life, and that rate is even higher for women of color, lesbian and bisexual women, transgender individuals, and other members of vulnerable or underserved communities.
The challenge before us right now is immense — we need bold action to fight this pandemic. That’s why @KamalaHarris and I are getting right to work preparing to get this virus under control.
I believe America is strongest when we work with our allies.

It's how we keep this country safe, counter terrorism and extremism, control this pandemic, deal with the climate crisis, and so much more.
While this team has unmatched experience and accomplishments, they also reflect the idea that we cannot meet the challenges we face with old thinking or unchanged habits. https://t.co/o9NWy59drg
I’ve long said that America leads not by the example of our power, but by the power of our example.

I am proud to put forward this incredible team that will lead by example. https://t.co/mz9twkgcil
Let’s begin the work to heal and unite America and the world.
This team is ready to lead the world, not retreat from it.

Ready to confront our adversaries, not reject our allies.

And ready to stand up for our values. https://t.co/DC0K6cJmpo
Despite overt political pressure from the president, over the last 24 hours, MI, PA, and NV certified their results and the GSA began the transition. Still, President Trump has not conceded.

Today, I’m announcing the first members of my national security and foreign policy team. They will rally the world to take on our challenges like no other—challenges that no one nation can face alone.

It’s time to restore American leadership. I trust this group to do just that. https://t.co/uKE5JG45Ts
I pledge to be a president who seeks not to divide, but to unify.

Who doesn’t see red and blue states, but a United States.

And who will work with all my heart to win the confidence of the whole people.
Anyone who wants a COVID-19 test should be able to get one. Period.
This afternoon, @KamalaHarris and I met with @SpeakerPelosi and @SenSchumer to discuss how we’ll get this virus under control, deliver much-needed relief, and build back better than before. 

We’re getting right to work for the American people. https://t.co/jbeNpsimdj

To transgender and gender-nonconforming people across America and around the world: from the moment I am sworn in as president, know that my administration will see you, listen to you, and fight for not only your safety but also the dignity and justice you have been denied.
At least 37 transgender and gender-nonconforming people have been killed this year, most of them Black and Brown transgender women. It’s intolerable. This Transgender Day of Remembrance, we honor their lives—and recommit to the work that remains to end this epidemic of violence.
Tune in as my campaign adviser Bob Bauer provides a post-election legal briefing. https://t.co/exoW4NprD3

Wearing a mask isn't a political statement — it's a patriotic duty.
This afternoon, @KamalaHarris and I met with a bipartisan group of governors from the @NatlGovsAssoc’s Executive Committee. We might be Democrats and Republicans, but we’re Americans first — and together, we’re going to beat COVID-19. https://t.co/pEkHtf4l4d
It’s not enough to praise our essential workers — we have to protect and pay them.
The workers on the frontlines of this pandemic are making extraordinary sacrifices every single day. They deserve leaders who will listen and work as hard for them as they are for their communities. As president, that’s exactly what I’ll do. https://t.co/wDu0p3sUQ2
The health care workers on the frontlines of this pandemic are true heroes. Tune in as we thank them for their work and discuss how a Biden-Harris administration will support them. https://t.co/RpBLnot7Be

I’m keeping in my prayers all of our friends and neighbors in Hurricane Iota’s path and those impacted by Hurricane Eta across Central America. The increasing frequency of these powerful storms is another reason that fighting climate change will be one of my top priorities.
Americans want us to cooperate. They want us to deliver results. That’s the choice Kamala and I will make. That's why I am pleased that today we were able to bring together business and labor leaders to make that choice with us.

We’re all Americans. Let’s get to work together.
When we build back better, we will do so with higher wages — including a $15 minimum wage — better benefits and stronger collective bargaining rights that you can raise a family on.

That’s how we will build back the middle class better than ever.
Right now, Congress should come together and pass a COVID relief package like the HEROES Act that the House passed six months ago. Once we shut down the virus and deliver economic relief to workers and businesses, then we can build back better than ever before.
Tune in as I deliver remarks on our economic recovery and how my administration plans to build back better in the long term. https://t.co/JOoK9xBRm1
Once again, I congratulate the brilliant women and men who produced this breakthrough and have brought us one step closer to beating this virus. I am also thankful for the frontline workers who are still confronting the virus around the clock.
Today's news of a second vaccine is further reason to feel hopeful. What was true with the first vaccine remains true with the second: we are still months away. Until then, Americans need to continue to practice social-distancing and mask-wearing to get the virus under control.
Congratulations to NASA and SpaceX on today's launch. It’s a testament to the power of science and what we can accomplish by harnessing our innovation, ingenuity, and determination. I join all Americans and the people of Japan in wishing the astronauts Godspeed on their journey.
To the millions of Hindus, Jains, Sikhs, and Buddhists celebrating the Festival of Lights, @DrBiden and I send our best wishes for a #HappyDiwali. May your new year be filled with hope, happiness, and prosperity. Sal Mubarak.
I am the president-elect, but will not be president until next year. COVID-19 does not respect dates on the calendar, it is accelerating right now. Urgent action is needed today, now, by the current administration.
I am alarmed by the surge in reported COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, and fatalities. This crisis demands a robust and immediate federal response which has been woefully lacking.
As the remnants of Tropical Storm Eta continue to impact the east coast, I encourage everyone in its path to heed the warnings of emergency responders and local officials. Jill and I send our prayers to those facing yet another storm.
Today marks five years since the horrific ISIS terrorist attacks in Paris — an assault not just on the people of France but against our common humanity.

As president, I will work to protect Americans and our allies, countering terrorism and extremist violence in all forms.
Because of the Affordable Care Act:

- People with pre-existing conditions are protected
- More than 20 million Americans gained coverage
- Nearly 12 million seniors have had their prescription drug costs reduced

Now more than ever, we have to protect and build on it. https://t.co/Vl5yliyUFm

We are going to build a health care system that puts you and your family first — and that every American can be proud of.
If you’re sick, if you’re struggling, if you’re worried about how you’re going to get through the day — we will not abandon you.

We will not leave you to face these challenges alone. https://t.co/eZUHaFE5bl
When I’m speaking to foreign leaders, I’m telling them: America is going to be back. We’re going to be back in the game.

Let's get to work, @KamalaHarris. https://t.co/uYe2EsmaFa
I won't be president until January 20th, but my message today to everyone is this: wear a mask.
The challenge before us right now is still immense and growing, and so is the need for bold action to fight this pandemic.
My COVID-19 Transition Advisory Board will advise on detailed plans built on a bedrock of science, and that keep compassion, empathy, and care for every American at its core.
Today, I have named a COVID-19 Transition Advisory Board, comprised of distinguished public health experts, to help our transition team translate the Biden-Harris COVID-19 plan into a blueprint we can put into place as soon as @KamalaHarris and I are sworn into office.
I spent the morning with the co-chairs of my COVID-19 Council discussing the status of this pandemic and how we move forward. Tune in as I provide an update on how we're going to beat this virus. https://t.co/VVGHZNnUFY
From the bottom of my heart: thank you. https://t.co/s76oHFkr66
A nation united.

A nation strengthened.

A nation healed.

The United States of America.
With full hearts and steady hands, with faith in America and in each other, with a love of country — and a thirst for justice — let us be the nation that we know we can be.
Tonight, the whole world is watching America. I believe at our best America is a beacon for the globe.

And we lead not by the example of our power, but by the power of our example.
Especially for those moments when this campaign was at its lowest — the African American community stood up again for me. They always have my back, and I’ll have yours.
I believe that this is part of the mandate from the American people. They want us to cooperate.

That’s the choice I’ll make. And I call on the Congress — Democrats and Republicans alike — to make that choice with me.
Now that the campaign is over—what is the people’s will? What is our mandate?

I believe it is this: Americans have called on us to marshal the forces of decency and the forces of fairness. To marshal the forces of science and the forces of hope in the great battles of our time.
We cannot repair the economy, restore our vitality, or relish life’s most precious moments — hugging a grandchild, birthdays, weddings, graduations, all the moments that matter most to us — until we get this virus under control.
The Bible tells us that to everything there is a season — a time to build, a time to reap, a time to sow. And a time to heal.

This is the time to heal in America.
It’s time to put away the harsh rhetoric.

To lower the temperature.

To see each other again.

To listen to each other again.
To all those who volunteered, worked the polls in the middle of this pandemic, local election officials — you deserve a special thanks from this nation.
For America’s educators, this is a great day: You’re going to have one of your own in the White House, and Jill is going to make a great First Lady.
I pledge to be a President who seeks not to divide, but to unify.

Who doesn’t see Red and Blue states, but a United States.

And who will work with all my heart to win the confidence of the whole people.
Folks, the people of this nation have spoken.

They have delivered us a clear victory. A convincing victory.

A victory for “We the People.”
A new day in America has come. Tune in as Vice President-Elect @KamalaHarris and I address the nation. https://t.co/d38F58DHu8
America, I’m honored that you have chosen me to lead our great country.

The work ahead of us will be hard, but I promise you this: I will be a President for all Americans — whether you voted for me or not.

I will keep the faith that you have placed in me. https://t.co/moA9qhmjn8
We may be opponents — but we are not enemies. 

We are Americans.
We have to remember the purpose of our politics isn’t totally unrelenting warfare.
I know tensions can be high after a tough election like we just had.

But we need to remain calm. Patient. And let the process work out as we count all the votes.
We are going to be the first Democrats to win Arizona in 24 years.

We are going to be the first Democrats to win Georgia in 28 years.

And we re-built the Blue Wall in the middle of the country that crumbled just four years ago.
What is becoming clearer each hour is that record numbers of Americans — from all races, faiths, regions — chose change over more of the same. 

They have given us a mandate for action on COVID and the economy and climate change and systemic racism.
The numbers tell us a clear and convincing story: We're going to win this race.
Tune in as I address the nation on the current state of the race. https://t.co/w0er4issEk
Donald Trump is going to court to stop votes from being counted. We have assembled the largest election protection effort in history to fight back and need your help.

Chip in to make sure every vote is counted: https://t.co/ksrwxu9nDE
Keep the faith, folks.
No one is going to take our democracy away from us. Not now, not ever.

America has come too far, fought too many battles, and endured too much to let that happen.
The people will not be silenced, be bullied, or surrender.

Every vote must be counted.
I spent the afternoon attending briefings on the ongoing COVID-19 crisis and the state of the economy. Tune in as I provide an update on these briefings and efforts to count every vote. https://t.co/duoDWfzf5C
I ask people to stay calm. 
The process is working. 
The count is being completed.
Democracy is sometimes messy, so sometimes it requires a little patience. 

But that patience has been rewarded now for more than 240 years with a system of governance that has been the envy of the world.
We’re fighting to ensure every last vote is counted across the country — and we need your help to do it. Chip in to the Biden Fight Fund to fuel our election protection efforts: https://t.co/VsuxvtqAFa
Let me be clear: I campaigned as a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American president. https://t.co/Mv5hHI2Rb3
Be patient, folks. Votes are being counted, and we feel good about where we are.
As votes continue to be counted across the country, tune in as my campaign manager @jomalleydillon and campaign adviser Bob Bauer give an update on where things stand. https://t.co/sKReFhHU5j
Every vote must be counted. https://t.co/kWLGRfeePK
Donald Trump does not decide the outcome of this election and nor do I. The American people decide. That’s why we’ve launched the Biden Fight Fund — to ensure every vote is counted.

Chip in to help fund our election protection efforts across the country: https://t.co/ps6VhGy0m5
I’m confident that we will emerge victorious.

But this will not be my victory alone.

It will be a victory for the American people. https://t.co/ZqJBVsQuQf
It’s clear that when the count is finished, we believe we will be the winners. https://t.co/qVk0igZlrF
Today, the Trump Administration officially left the Paris Climate Agreement. And in exactly 77 days, a Biden Administration will rejoin it. https://t.co/L8UJimS6v2
Keep faith in the process and in each other. Together, we will win this.
I am confident we will emerge victorious, but this will not be my victory or our victory alone. It will be a victory for the American people, for our democracy, for America.
To make progress, we have to stop treating our opponents as enemies. We are not enemies.
Once this election is finalized and behind us, it will be time for us to do what we've always done as Americans: To put the harsh rhetoric of the campaign behind us.
Every vote must be counted. No one is going to take our democracy away from us, not now, not ever.
The presidency, itself, is not a partisan institution. It's the one office in the nation that represents everyone and it demands a duty of care for all Americans, and that is precisely what I will do.
Power can't be taken or asserted, it flows from the people, and it's their will that determines who will be the President of the United States.
Tune in as I address the nation on the state of the race. https://t.co/00QtuYAiI7
Count every vote.
To make sure every vote is counted, we’re setting up the largest election protection effort ever assembled. Because Donald Trump doesn’t get to decide the outcome of this election — the American people do.

Chip in to power the new Biden Fight Fund: https://t.co/1hCoKB0QfP
We won't rest until everyone's vote is counted. Tune in as my campaign manager @jomalleydillon and campaign adviser Bob Bauer give an update on where the race stands. https://t.co/Rwz4iR25B3
We feel good about where we are. We believe we are on track to win this election.
It's not my place or Donald Trump's place to declare the winner of this election. It's the voters' place.
Keep the faith, guys. We’re gonna win this.
Tune in as I speak to the nation live from Wilmington, Delaware. https://t.co/ye8knRucoz

In 2008 and 2012, you placed your trust in me to help lead this country alongside Barack Obama.

Today, I’m asking for your trust once again — this time, in Kamala and me.

We can heal the soul of this nation — I promise we won’t let you down.

https://t.co/eoxT07uII9 https://t.co/VwZkmZ53F4
It all comes down to this.

Go vote: https://t.co/eoxT07uII9 https://t.co/0Sj7qlj5Bl
It’s Election Day. Go vote, America!
Let's bring this home. https://t.co/tDQ2T0LCbQ
I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American president.

I will work with Democrats and Republicans, and I’ll work as hard for those who don’t support me as for those who do.

Because that’s the job of a president.
Under President Trump:

- Over 230,000 Americans have died from COVID-19
- 30 million people have lost hours, paychecks, or jobs
- Nearly one in five small businesses have closed

Are you better off than you were four years ago?
As president, I will:

– Rebuild our infrastructure
– Combat climate change
– Create millions of good-paying, union jobs

It’s time to build back better –– together. https://t.co/Mb9dvTcuKH
If we give Donald Trump another four years in the White House, our planet will never recover.
Everybody knows who Donald Trump is.

Let’s show them who we are.

We choose hope over fear. Unity over division. Science over fiction. And truth over lies.
Los Dreamers son estadounidenses y ya es hora de que sea oficial.
Dreamers are Americans — and it’s time we make it official.
If we give Donald Trump another four years in the White House, he will forever alter the character of our nation.

We can’t let that happen.
I believe health care is a right for all.

Donald Trump believes it's a privilege for the few.

It's that simple, folks.
Tomorrow, let's send a clear message to Donald Trump: time to pack your bags and go home. https://t.co/3ApUpY9kBV
I believe LGBTQ+ rights are human rights — and they are on the ballot tomorrow.

I’ve said it many times: I’m more optimistic about America’s future today than I was when I got elected to the United States Senate as a 29-year-old.
Young people have the power to own the outcome of this election.

Use it: https://t.co/eoxT07uII9 https://t.co/u37NbIEjwC
Let’s restore honor and decency to the White House.
Donald Trump will always fight for his wealthy and well-connected friends. I’ll always fight for you.
Who we are. What we believe. Who we want to be. It’s all at stake tomorrow.

Vote. https://t.co/eoxT07d7QB
After tonight's horrific terrorist attack in Vienna, Austria, Jill and I are keeping the victims and their families in our prayers. We must all stand united against hate and violence.
President Trump ignored the pandemic playbook that President Obama and I left him, so we decided to bring it back out and go over what he missed. https://t.co/ZHq5OCZwaN
Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in modern history.

Donald Trump is the most racist president in modern history.

Donald Trump is the worst jobs president in modern history.

Why would we give him another four years?
Here’s the truth: Donald Trump inherited a growing economy from President Obama and me. And just like everything else he’s inherited in life, he squandered it.
I’m speaking with members of the African American community in Pittsburgh about the power of the vote — and the future we can build together. Tune in. https://t.co/1wFBiLoCWu
When America votes, America will be heard. And when America is heard, I believe the message is going to be loud and clear: It’s time for Donald Trump to leave the White House.
A Biden-Harris administration will:

- Implement nationwide mask mandates
- Ensure access to regular, reliable, and free testing
- Accelerate the development and distribution of safe and effective treatments and vaccines

We won’t waste any time getting this virus under control.
Health care. 
Civil rights.
Climate change. 
Economic inequality. 
Racial justice.
The Supreme Court.
Our democracy.

They’re all at stake. Vote. https://t.co/eoxT07d7QB
Together, we're going to rebuild our economy. And when we do, we'll not only build it back — we'll build it back better.
You have the power to own the outcome of this election and determine the course of our country for generations to come.

It’s go time, America.

https://t.co/eoxT07uII9 https://t.co/5Hxi1E8CVe
In public, President Trump compared COVID-19 to the flu and suggested people inject bleach to treat it.

In private, he told Bob Woodward it was deadlier than the flu and that he wanted to downplay it.

It’s unthinkable.
I have always believed you can define America in one word: possibilities. And I refuse to postpone those possibilities any longer.

There is so much we can achieve as a nation with Donald Trump out of the White House.

I started this campaign saying we were in a battle for the soul of this nation — and I believe that even more deeply today.

But make no mistake: It’s a battle we can and will win.
Our president has failed in his most basic duty to this nation: to protect us.

It’s unforgivable.
The hard truth is that our economy wasn't working for folks long before this crisis. It's why we can't just go back to the way things were — we have to build back better.

Here's how we'll do it: https://t.co/rt5RD9Fdi0
Vote for respect.
Vote for decency.
Vote for truth.
Vote for leadership.

Donald Trump sees the world from Park Avenue.

It's why I'll fight every day as president to make this country work for middle class and low-income Americans — not just the wealthy and well-connected.
No one fights harder for the people of Alabama than my friend, @DougJones. He's a Senator with a big heart and he's never afraid to fight for what's right.

Under my tax plan, no one making under $400,000 will see their taxes go up.

Donald Trump is trying to eliminate the entire Affordable Care Act in the middle of a pandemic.

If he gets his way, more than 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions could see their costs skyrocket or be denied coverage altogether.

We can’t let him win. https://t.co/DoTV2uw1bn
It’s long past time President Trump and his wealthy friends paid their fair share in taxes.
Scranton, Pennsylvania, isn't just where I'm from — it's the people I'm for. I'll fight every single day in the White House for the hardworking Americans who make our country run. https://t.co/vahd9rc1Ja

It’s long past time we take action to end the scourge of gun violence in America.

As president, I’ll ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, implement universal background checks, and enact other common-sense reforms to end our gun violence epidemic.
More than 230,000 Americans have died from COVID-19 –– and Donald Trump has given up on trying to get the virus under control.

He may have quit on you, but I promise I never will.
There are just two days until Election Day, and our campaign is working around the clock to get folks to vote.

Can you chip in to help us reach every last voter before polls close on Tuesday? https://t.co/owL20qONri

- Health care is a right

The Trump Administration knew how deadly this virus was back in February.

But they didn't tell you or your family. Instead, they gave a heads up to their friends on Wall Street so investors could make a profit before the recession hit.

They hid the truth. It's unforgivable.
I'm running as a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American president. https://t.co/d5tmoNSnco
We need a president who believes in science and listens to someone other than himself.

Desde sus actos atroces con la separación de familias en nuestra frontera hasta su ignorancia con el pueblo puertorriqeño después del huracán María, el presidente Trump ha atacado la dignidad de las familias latinas una y otra vez.

From his heinous acts of separating families at our border to his neglect of the people of Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria, President Trump has attacked the dignity of Latino families time and time again.

It will end when I’m president.
2 days. Finish strong.
I promise you this: I’ll end Donald Trump’s chaos and end this crisis.

Success in a Biden-Harris Administration will not be measured just by the stock market or GDP growth, but by the extent to which growth is raising the pay, dignity, and economic security of our working families—especially those who have been left behind. https://t.co/HQZ8UbUb3f
GDP rose last quarter, but visits to food banks haven’t slowed, and poverty has grown. We’re on track for the worst economic downturn in over 70 years, and Donald Trump is on track to be the first president since Herbert Hoover to leave office with less jobs than when he came in.
History says, don't hope
On this side of the grave.
But then, once in a lifetime
The longed-for tidal wave
Of justice can rise up,
And hope and history rhyme.

Now, I need your help — chip in to keep tonight’s momentum going through Election Day: https://t.co/9lrG3uFUIx
I'm running as a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American president. I will represent you — whether you vote for me or against me.
Decency, honor, respect, treating people with dignity, making sure that everyone has an even chance.

I'm going to make sure you get that. You haven't been getting it the last four years. https://t.co/KhQIGGZHIH
Donald Trump is the most racist president in modern history. https://t.co/6GyKSbRoHA
You know who I am. You know who Donald Trump is. 

The character of the country is on the ballot. https://t.co/LdiIAOhHLj
There is institutional racism in America.

We have to give everyone a fair shot. https://t.co/rB8qzFT8rR
Kids were ripped from their parents’ arms, and now they can't find their parents.

Those kids are alone. With nowhere to go.

It’s criminal. https://t.co/HsfQayx3ZV
Donald Trump has a dog whistle about as big as a foghorn.
You know who I am. You know who he is.

The character of the country is on the ballot. Look at us closely.
Equality and justice — the American creed. We have never lived up to it, but we’ve never stopped trying — until this President.
Call it Bidencare. https://t.co/Ng3Fvk4fpY
This isn’t about Donald Trump’s family or my family. This is about your family.

Families across America are hurting — but that’s the last thing Donald Trump wants to talk about. https://t.co/qWMgnLHxKY
All Donald Trump can see from Park Avenue is Wall Street.

He thinks the economy is doing well if the Dow Jones is doing well.

Believe it or not, Mr. President, most Americans don't live off the stock market.
He’s a confused guy. He doesn’t know who he’s running against. He’s running against Joe Biden.
We’ve been waiting years for President Trump to reveal his grand plan for health care, and he still has nothing to show.

I’ve laid out exactly what I’ll do. Take a look: https://t.co/34NCSYhO2C
I have released all of my tax returns. 22 years. Go look at them.

What is Donald Trump hiding? https://t.co/2TNt0z1QMw
It’s not about his family or my family. It’s about your family.

If you’re a middle-class family right now, you’re hurting badly.
Malarkey!
I don’t see our country in terms of blue states and red states. We are the United States. https://t.co/7G5IXGA9fu
Donald Trump should release his tax returns or shut up about corruption.
I don’t look at this the way Donald Trump does — blue states or red states. They’re all the United States.
I’m going to shut down the virus, not the country.
Learning to live with it? Come on. People are dying with it, Mr. President.
Ready. https://t.co/RYbnSpEsKB
I need you in my corner tonight. Can you chip in before I take the debate stage and help power this campaign through the final 12 days? https://t.co/RAUkSHc6ce
Folks, the final debate is here. Tune in at 9 PM ET as I go head-to-head with Donald Trump for the last time before Election Day.
Donald Trump sees the world from Park Avenue.

I see it from where I came from: Scranton, Pennsylvania. 

It's why I'll fight every day as president to make this country work for the middle class — not the wealthy and well-connected.
I’m running as a proud Democrat. But I will be an American president.
I’m always talking about my plans to build back better for all Americans. But what does that really mean for you and your family? 

Watch as @ewarren helps explain: https://t.co/ti7QJCU7j0
On this International Stuttering Awareness Day, I want everyone to remember that the barriers you face don't define who you are. They didn't for me –– as a young boy who stuttered –– and they certainly don't for Brayden.

What defines you is your heart and your courage. https://t.co/zoVPzmroJh
Folks, it's go-time. This is the most important election of our lifetimes — and you can make all the difference.

Vote. https://t.co/eoxT07uII9
Vote like your health care is on the ballot — because it is.

https://t.co/eoxT07uII9 https://t.co/93UPvti02N
Thank you to each and every person who has gotten involved in our campaign so far. Whether you chipped in a few dollars or dedicated a few hours of your time — I’m incredibly grateful. Let’s keep our foot on the pedal these final 12 days and finish strong. https://t.co/Rh7jn4HODX
I’ve spent my entire career fighting for the middle class and standing up to the abuse of power.

Donald Trump has spent his entire career looking out for himself and abusing his power. https://t.co/Vie5CP9wq7

You need a valid excuse to vote absentee-by-mail. If you are eligible, head to https://t.co/oGZw9Kg8SH and request yours before it’s too late.
Folks, you heard @BarackObama: Make a plan, vote early, and make sure your friends and family do as well.

https://t.co/eoxT07d7QB https://t.co/deCh7bW9IS
America was an idea. We've never lived up to it but we've never walked away from it before.

https://t.co/VRCnKI0rfQ https://t.co/xLuhhGyJVp

Vote early.

Vote by mail.

Vote on Election Day.

Just make sure you vote. https://t.co/eoxT07d7QB
President Trump didn't take the necessary precautions to protect himself and others.

How can we trust him to protect the country?
I couldn’t be more excited to have my friend @BarackObama hitting the campaign trail. Tune in for his first drive-in rally live from Philadelphia. https://t.co/NJyChqivOt
It’s time we replace Secretary Betsy DeVos with an actual public school educator — one who values our public schools and is capable of guiding all of our schools through this pandemic.

Vote: https://t.co/eoxT07d7QB https://t.co/CWf3H5BqOH
Tune in as @BarackObama sits down with community leaders in Philadelphia to talk about what’s at stake in this election. https://t.co/Xzmy0Cs3sw
Hay muchos asuntos que son complicados, pero algunas cosas son visiblemente claras. Las familias deben permanecer unidas. https://t.co/rLC69J5rHI
There are many issues that are complicated, but some things are just black and white. Families belong together. https://t.co/TgIkhAMAtZ
Cada día parece que descubrimos nuevos horrores cometidos por el presidente Trump y su administración. https://t.co/eefL58X7R8
Every day it seems we uncover new horrors perpetrated by President Trump and his administration. https://t.co/eefL58X7R8
The Build Back Better Express Tour was about more than my love for trains — it was about meeting folks along the way and discussing how we can make their lives better.

They are the backbone of America — and I’ll fight for them every day in the White House. https://t.co/HhJHo35DvD
Justice is on the ballot.

I’ve always believed we’re at our best when we’re one America. If we come together, there’s not a single thing we cannot overcome.
If I’m elected president, I won’t waste a minute getting this virus under control. Here’s how I’ll do it: https://t.co/NoPsQ0FDV8
Whether it’s your first time voting or you’re an old pro, voting is better with friends and family. So message a few folks and make your plan to vote together today.

https://t.co/uoiVh9ZqzI https://t.co/clVe9wpOMi
Listening to scientists is not a bad thing.

I can’t believe that has to be said.
America is a nation that values immigrants. It is and has always been one of our greatest strengths.

We need a president who understands that. https://t.co/fIuNJUrfY3
A few weeks ago, I spoke to Mr. Rogers’ wife Joanne when I was in her neighborhood in Pittsburgh. It was a great conversation.

Friendship, empathy, kindness, and compassion — I think we could all learn a thing or two from her and her husband’s example. https://t.co/lRX9jt7FXS

Two weeks from today, we’re going to beat President Trump.
Mr. President, the people are tired. They’re tired of your lies about this virus. They’re tired of watching more Americans die, and more people lose their jobs because you refuse to take this pandemic seriously. https://t.co/pdxdo3FadB
Waving a white flag and saying, “it is what it is” is unacceptable when thousands are dying each week, when businesses are closing, and when schools remain shuttered. The American people have never backed down from a challenge, but they need a leader to show the way.
Yesterday, @realDonaldTrump decided to attack Dr. Fauci once again, calling him a ‘disaster’ and public health experts ‘idiots.’ Meanwhile, he still has no plan to beat this virus.
Happy Birthday, @KamalaHarris. Next year, let’s celebrate with some ice cream at the White House. https://t.co/SWhS32AaIE
If you live in Hawaii, Utah, or Wisconsin, in-person early voting is now underway.

Millions of Americans across the country have already voted. Join them and cast your ballot today. https://t.co/eoxT07uII9
Maryland and New Mexico — if you plan to vote by mail, today is the last day to request your absentee ballot.

Head to https://t.co/eoxT07d7QB before it's too late.
The simple, sad truth is that this president is not in office to serve the American people. He’s in it to serve himself.

@KamalaHarris and I are in this for you and your families. https://t.co/mV9ONHhn1b
Pennsylvania — there are just a few hours left to register to vote online. Don’t miss your chance to make your voice heard in this election. Head to https://t.co/U1KkwCfDCV and register before 11:59 PM.
For once, Donald Trump is correct: I will listen to scientists. https://t.co/jmxoDn1Ezp
I will be a president who pushes towards the future. Not one who clings to the past.
.@realDonaldTrump — if you had listened to the scientists, it wouldn't be this bad. https://t.co/0eNuV4pAMK
Folks, the Avengers are coming back together for their biggest battle yet. Join them and @KamalaHarris tomorrow night for a grassroots fundraiser you won’t want to miss: https://t.co/D4fn4nxv9i https://t.co/3sGQRBW7yu
We are in a battle for the soul of this nation — and it’s a battle we can and must win.

Vote. https://t.co/eoxT07d7QB

Early voting starts today in:

Alaska

North Dakota

Don't wait until November 3rd to cast your ballot — vote early today: https://t.co/eoxT07d7QB https://t.co/X5ylgiW5Ss
This election is about so much more than policies. The soul of America is on the ballot. 

@KamalaHarris and I will work every day to bind up our wounds and bring this country back together. https://t.co/hsy8JIIAqk
It’s long past time we build an economy that rewards work — not wealth. https://t.co/rm9AK6rBxW
Together, we can put an end to the last four years of darkness, division, and chaos.

We can unite, mend our wounds, and begin to heal.

It starts at the ballot box: https://t.co/eoxT07uII9 https://t.co/bmpMpedpdQ
15 days. Let’s finish strong.
...yes https://t.co/RzZ3j3zoAL
You have the power to own the outcome of this election — but only if you vote.

Wear a mask. Wash your hands. Vote out Donald Trump.
I’ve had a rule my entire life: No matter what’s happening, no matter how important the meeting, I’ll always answer a call from my grandchildren. https://t.co/mmsB1GOxAu
I believe there is not a single thing we cannot accomplish as a country if we do it together. https://t.co/suxrTITkTm
The truth is things in life are easier when you have a plan — and that includes voting. So my team set up a tool to help you make your plan to vote. Check it out: https://t.co/uoiVh9ZqzI
From tackling climate change to making community college free for all — I've got big plans for the country.

And I'll pay for them by making sure the super-wealthy, like President Trump, pay more than $750 in federal income taxes.
I’ve spent my entire career fighting for a more just, safe, and prosperous America — and I’m not finished yet. https://t.co/cS3LPT7afX
COVID-19 cases are on the rise across the nation.

But instead of leading by example, Donald Trump continues to put others in danger with his campaign events that ignore expert-recommended precautions.

Every day he proves just how unfit he is to lead America through this crisis.
I’m in Durham, North Carolina, encouraging folks to make their plan to vote early. Tune in — and then head to https://t.co/uoiVh9HPb8 to make yours. https://t.co/lNw7Jxuh65

Turns out Twitter isn’t so bad when you read tweets that aren’t from President Trump. https://t.co/ZKA2dwZQks
A job is about a lot more than a paycheck.

It's about dignity. It's about respect. It's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say everything will be okay.

Too many people today can't do that — and it's got to change.
Every day we're reminded just how much is at stake in this election. We can't afford to have anyone sit on the sidelines.

Vote. https://t.co/eoxT07d7QB
In the middle of a pandemic, President Trump is trying to eliminate Obamacare and increase health care costs for millions.

Now, he’s rushing through a U.S. Supreme Court justice to help him get it done. It’s unconscionable. 

Make no mistake: Health care is on the ballot.
If we do our part, if we stand together, if we keep faith with the past and with each other — then the divisions of our time can give way to the dreams of a brighter, better future. 

That is our work. That is our pledge. That is our mission.
Promise? https://t.co/Wbl86i8uYo
This election is bigger than any one candidate. 

It's about the future of our economy, our health care, our climate, our commitment to racial justice, our democracy –– and so much more.

We have to vote. https://t.co/eoxT07d7QB
As president, I’ll protect and build on Obamacare by:

- Giving Americans the choice to buy a new public option
- Lowering premiums, deductibles, and co-pays
- Standing up to prescription drug corporations

We’re going to make sure every American has access to the care they need.
You deserve a president who will actually tell you the truth. https://t.co/I9XzZ0ADmT

Violence against transgender and gender non-conforming people — particularly Black and Brown transgender women — is an epidemic that needs national leadership. But Donald Trump has done nothing but fan the flames of transphobia.

It has to end. https://t.co/v2DAbcIcCv
Let’s be clear: The emergency aid should have never been denied in the first place. https://t.co/GZuhSNSY7y

Not only does President Trump refuse to grant Temporary Protected Status to Venezuelans, but he also apparently used stealth deportations to send them back to the oppressive Maduro regime.

It’s abundantly clear he has no regard for the suffering of the Venezuelan people. https://t.co/wJnQ5EDT7M
You have the power to prevent 2016 from happening again — but only if you vote.

https://t.co/eoxT07d7QB https://t.co/ujWChoXpYK
We need a president who will expand access to health care — not one who does everything he can to tear it away.
We can’t let President Trump tear down Obamacare — we have to protect and build on it. Tune in as I speak live from Michigan about my plans to give more Americans access to affordable health care. https://t.co/RZ8hakbLbe

I’ll change the law.

I'm running as a proud Democrat, but I'm going to be an American president. 

I'm going to take care of those who voted against me as well as those who voted for me. 

That's what presidents do.
We're a diverse country — and unless we are able to treat people equally, we're just never going to meet our potential.
Folks, I hope I’m making you proud during tonight’s town hall.

If you’re with us, please chip in to help power our campaign over these final 19 days. https://t.co/rA9WmMPRxs
Two of the things I've cared about throughout my whole career:

1. Improving the criminal justice system.
2. Putting Black Americans in a position to gain generational wealth.

And as president, I will continue that fight every day.
The words of a president matter. https://t.co/ABrbg5xTkg
Let me be very clear: If you make under $400,000 you won’t pay a penny more in taxes under my administration.
The words of a president matter. And when a president doesn't wear a mask or makes fun of folks who do, it has consequences.
We're eight months into this pandemic, and Donald Trump still doesn't have a plan to get this virus under control.

I do.
I’m about to step on stage for tonight’s town hall in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Tune in to @ABC to watch live.

Well, folks, @KamalaHarris and I watched some of President Trump’s remarks from the campaign trail — and it went just as you’d imagine. We wanted to take a moment to clear up some of the lies he’s been saying about us. https://t.co/QWqXp3qdSD
Our campaign’s contact tracing remains ongoing, and my team will continue to share any significant developments with the American people. If anything, let this serve as an example of the importance of wearing masks and keeping a safe, social distance.
Not only was the individual 50+ feet away and wearing a mask, but I was wearing an N-95 mask. No members of my staff were in contact with this crew member either.  My doctors have advised that there is no need for me to quarantine.
During our contact tracing, we discovered around noon today that a member of the company that charters my airplane has also tested positive for COVID. This crew member was on the plane with me, but was more than 50 feet away. 

My COVID test from last night came back negative.
Donald Trump is rushing through Justice Ginsburg's replacement because he's laser-focused on destroying the Affordable Care Act.

@KamalaHarris @DouglasEmhoff Happy Birthday, @DouglasEmhoff!
Donald Trump has been trying to throw out Obamacare for years.

And now he sees an opportunity to finally get it done, all while ignoring the will of the people.

We can’t let him.
Three weeks from today, we’re going to make Donald Trump a one-term president.
I am ready to fight for you and for our nation. Every day. Without exception, without reservation. And with a full and devoted heart.
We need a president who will unite our country and bring out our best — not one who stokes division and brings out our worst.
Today marks 22 years since Matthew Shepard passed away after a brutal anti-gay hate crime. Over two decades later, violence against LGBTQ+ Americans is at an all-time high. As president, I'll strengthen our hate crimes laws and make clear that bigotry has no place in America.
There's no question: we are neck and neck in Ohio — and with early voting underway and only 22 days until Election Day, there's no time to waste. Join us live from Cincinnati as we get out the vote: https://t.co/oMwv9s2sLE
Donald Trump is running TV ads taking Dr. Fauci out of context and without his permission.

So, here’s a message from the President in his own words. https://t.co/WCYbIfrQLR
The longer Donald Trump is president, the more reckless he gets.
I know Americans aren’t looking for a handout. They just want a fair chance to get ahead — and I’ll work every day to make sure folks get that chance.
I'm in Toledo, Ohio, to discuss my plans to build the economy back better for working families. Tune in. https://t.co/MXlsFdS3Xt
Georgia — you don’t have to wait until November 3rd to cast your ballot. Early voting begins today.

On this Indigenous People’s Day, we must both recognize the past that has brought us here, and commit to one another to write a new future of promise, partnership, and equal opportunity for the proud Tribal Nations of our country. https://t.co/7bOkPVCJc3
From Seneca Falls to Selma to Stonewall, we’re at our best when the promise of America is available to all.
Brayden — you have heart, courage, and maturity beyond your years. You have unlimited potential — and I can't wait to see what your future holds. https://t.co/7t2mHOXNMa
This election, you have the power to choose:

Hope over fear.
Truth over lies.
Unity over division.

Vote. https://t.co/eoxT07uII9
I helped pull this country out of a recession before — and, as president, I’ll do it again.
In January, I said President Trump was the worst possible leader to deal with a public health crisis. And everything we’ve been through in the months since has proven that to be true. https://t.co/twcy3Ql0Xc
When President Trump was told one thousand Americans were dying every day from COVID-19, he shrugged it off and said, it is what it is.

It is what it is?

This president doesn't even pretend to care about the Americans he swore to serve. It's disgraceful.
Today we join Polish-Americans in celebrating General Pulaski, whose heroism built the American cavalry and saved the life of George Washington. America will always stand with the Polish people against the common threats we face.
I want every member of the LGBTQ+ community to know you are loved and accepted just as you are — whether you've come out or not. I'll fight every day in the White House to create a country where you can live open, proud, and free — without fear. #NationalComingOutDay
There is no excuse for President Trump’s reckless behavior. https://t.co/ooUh6pxRDt
One in five small businesses have closed.
More than 25 million Americans are on unemployment.
Millions are at risk of losing their homes.

But President Trump doesn’t seem to care. He only cares about how he and his wealthy friends are doing.
America has to be about the possibilities of prosperity. 

Not just for the privileged few. But for the many — for all of us.
The fact is this pandemic has exposed the cracks in our already broken mental health care system.

We can and must do better.

As president, I’ll fight to achieve mental health parity, expand access to care, and wipe out the stigma. #WorldMentalHealthDay
I’m in Erie, Pennsylvania, to discuss my plans to build back better. Tune in. https://t.co/8NqGra1egn
We're eight months into this crisis, and this president still has no plan to rebuild our economy.

I do. I'll get America back to work — and build back better.

Here's how: https://t.co/XjiTnHDiUk
Let’s go vote, America.

https://t.co/eoxT07d7QB https://t.co/Nso0pXH7ER
We need a president who understands hardworking Americans — not one who looks down on them.
What does building back better mean for you?

- Millions of new, good-paying jobs
- A $15 federal minimum wage
- Stronger benefits and fair workplaces
- An economy that works for everyone—not just the wealthy
- The choice to join a union

That's the future we can build together.
If you're sick, struggling, or worried about how you're going to get through the day — know you are not alone.

We're all in this together. And together, we'll emerge stronger than before. https://t.co/ztiKctOcHW

It’s estimated that nearly another 200,000 Americans could lose their lives by the end of the year because of this virus.

Enough. No more.

Let’s set the partisanship aside. Let’s end the politics. Let’s follow the science.
Why did Donald Trump tell Bob Woodward the truth about COVID-19, but not the American people?
Congratulations to the UN World Food Program. With global hunger on the march, made worse by the pandemic and conflict around the world, we must come together to fight food insecurity. As president, I'll support the WFP and reassert American leadership to address global hunger. https://t.co/mt5uwCG5zT
25 days. Let’s win this thing.
What we need in America is leadership that seeks to de-escalate tensions, to open lines of communication, and to bring us together. To heal — and to hope.

As president, that is precisely what I will do.
Jill and I are keeping the Gulf Coast in our prayers tonight. If you’re in Hurricane Delta’s path, please heed the advice of local officials, take steps to prepare, and stay safe. https://t.co/GAtLxm1n3S

After last night, I just had to write a note about my friend and running mate, @KamalaHarris. https://t.co/FYPXV5dZZG
.@KamalaHarris is right: If you have a pre-existing condition, the Trump Administration is coming for you.

Vote like your health care depends on it — because it does.

https://t.co/eoxT07d7QB https://t.co/Nf4IJZvL7U
Last night, @KamalaHarris chose truth over lies.

She chose hope and unity over fear and division.

She showed America what true leadership looks like — and I couldn't be prouder.
Every generation that has followed Gettysburg has been faced with a moment when it must answer this question: Will we allow the sacrifices made in that battle, and that war, to be in vain?
 
We cannot, and we must not. It's time to come together. https://t.co/jmVGQRS4zy
Folks, there was only one person on last night’s debate stage who’s fit to serve as Vice President — and her name is @KamalaHarris.
I promise you that as president, I will always appeal to the best in us — not the worst. https://t.co/E07GuV4m7G
I’m running as a proud Democrat. But I will govern as an American president. https://t.co/UgNPbQdNZH
We must seek not to build walls, but bridges.

We must seek not to clench our fists, but to open our arms.

We must seek not to tear each other apart, but to come together.
Last night @KamalaHarris showed America exactly why she’ll make an incredible Vice President. https://t.co/9BCqSUrl50
.@KamalaHarris, you made us all proud tonight.
https://t.co/TtWm3i4eaq.
Pitch in $5 to help this campaign fly. https://t.co/CqHAId0j8t https://t.co/NbkPl0a8HV
Donald Trump has made hate, division, and dog whistles central to his campaign from the very beginning – and last week he couldn't even condemn white supremacists. It’s a pattern.
Let me be clear: A Biden-Harris Administration won't increase taxes by a dime on anyone making less than $400,000 a year.
.@KamalaHarris is showing the American people why I chose her as my running mate. She’s smart, she’s experienced, she’s a proven fighter for the middle class. She’ll be an incredible Vice President.
We’re eight months into this pandemic and Donald Trump and Mike Pence still have no plan to deal with COVID-19. He’s still hoping it will just “disappear.”

@KamalaHarris and I have a comprehensive, science-backed plan to defeat this virus.

Take a look: https://t.co/xjxsDn2qCD
.@KamalaHarris is about to take the debate stage –– but before she does, I need your help.

Will you chip in to make sure Kamala knows you’ve got her back as she takes on Vice President Pence? https://t.co/QwFRpbMJVC

I know @KamalaHarris will do a great job. Join me and tune in at 9 PM ET to cheer her on.
These families fled persecution and violence to seek safety in the land of the free.

But instead of providing refuge, the Trump Administration ripped their children away from them.

I won’t waste any time getting this virus under control.
Please. https://t.co/acHR1Rf8hE

Climate change is already here, and ignoring science won't make it go away. If we give the Trump Administration another four years, we'll lose irreplaceable time to combat it. https://t.co/cexxSVQLOQ
Make no mistake: if you are out of work, if your business is closed, if your child’s school is shut down, if you are seeing layoffs in your community, Donald Trump decided today that none of that matters to him.
The President turned his back on you. https://t.co/oeI8dck2LL
I give you my word: If I am elected president, I will marshal the ingenuity and goodwill of this nation to turn division into unity and bring us together.
As president, I will embrace:

Hope, not fear.
Peace, not violence.
Generosity, not greed.
Light, not darkness. 

I will be a president who appeals to the best in us. Not the worst.
We fought a Civil War that would secure a Union that would seek to fulfill the promise of equality for all.

And by fits and starts, our better angels have prevailed just enough against our worst impulses to make a new and better nation.

Those better angels must prevail again.
The pandemic is not a red state versus blue state issue. The virus doesn’t care where you live or what political party you belong to.

It infects us all. It will take anyone’s life. It is a virus — not a political weapon.
I do not believe we have to choose between law and order and racial justice in America.
As president, I will send a clear, unequivocal message to the entire nation: There is no place for hate in America.

It will be given no license. It will be given no oxygen. It will be given no safe harbor.
We are engaged once again in a battle for the soul of the nation. It’s a battle we’ve been in before and we can win again. Tune in as I deliver remarks from Gettysburg. https://t.co/I9KItf8Fjn

Jill and I send our thoughts to President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump for a swift recovery. We will continue to pray for the health and safety of the president and his family.
Donald Trump will do everything he can to distract from the fact that because of his failed COVID-19 response:

- Over 200,000 Americans have died
- 26 million are on unemployment
- 1 in 6 small businesses risk permanent closure

We can’t let him.
When I first ran for Senate, we put up a billboard that said, “Joe Biden: For all our families.”

We're in Alliance, Ohio, for stop two of the Build Back Better Express Tour. Tune in now to watch. https://t.co/N6K38Z0ANO
All aboard! Tune in as @DrBiden and I kick off our train tour through Ohio and Pennsylvania. https://t.co/z2m4tpAHNJ
Had enough? https://t.co/4W5OSoRzXI
There’s no other way to put it: the President of the United States refused to disavow white supremacists on the debate stage last night. https://t.co/Q3VZTW1vUV
Folks, we don't have to put up with four more years of that. https://t.co/aIt2BNuQg3
This. This is Donald Trump's America. https://t.co/wld2mmGTwe
After tonight, the choice in this election has never been clearer — and with 35 days to go, the stakes have never been higher. Tomorrow marks our final end-of-quarter deadline, and we need your help to hit our goal.

Chip in to help beat Donald Trump: https://t.co/qenDA6FsjW
You heard a lot come out of President Trump’s mouth. Can you name one thing he said to actually make your life better?
You have it in your control to determine what this country’s gonna look like the next four years. Is it going to change –– or are you going to get four more years of these lies? https://t.co/eoxT07uII9
We need a president who will bring us together — not tear us further apart. https://t.co/kGfg63xbYE
You determine the outcome of this election. Vote. Vote. Vote. https://t.co/Ros3XuU16k
Under this president, we have become weaker, sicker, poorer, more divided, and more violent. 

When I was vice president, we inherited a recession, I was asked to fix it, and I did.

We left Donald Trump a booming economy, and he caused a recession. https://t.co/uEMPaTtZ7F
Go to: https://t.co/eoxT07uII9
Under this president, we’ve become weaker, sicker, poorer, more divided, and more violent.
Beau Biden was not a loser. https://t.co/hwzlZrjh75
Donald Trump isn't a law and order president. He's a president who breaks the law and creates disorder.
Donald Trump talks a lot about the art of the deal. But under his watch, China has perfected the art of the steal. https://t.co/OSTsHHTtBQ
More jobs were created in the final three years of the Obama-Biden Administration than in the first three years of Donald Trump’s presidency. 

A million and a half more jobs. https://t.co/3Y75JhJY0n
On average, roughly 750 to 1,000 Americans are dying from COVID every day.

When Donald Trump was presented with that number, he said, “It is what it is.”

It is what it is because Donald Trump is who he is. https://t.co/OOm2pVRijz
Show us your tax returns, @realDonaldTrump.
Donald Trump is the worst president we've ever had.
When I hear 200,000 deaths, I think of the empty chairs at dining room tables all across the country, which just months ago were filled by loved ones.

It didn’t have to be this bad.
It is what it is because Donald Trump is who he is.
The American people deserve to have a say in who the Supreme Court nominee is. https://t.co/jnFXiDkt2c
President Trump keeps promising to protect Americans with pre-existing conditions, but the truth is he’s in Court trying to rip their protections away.

And now, he’s trying to jam through the confirmation of a Justice who will help him get it done.

We can’t let him win.
I’m about to step on stage to debate Donald Trump for the first time. But before I do, can you chip in to show him the power of our grassroots base? Every donation — big or small — goes a long way. https://t.co/HiNSLIqIPQ
This election is Scranton vs. Park Avenue — and with your help, Scranton will win. https://t.co/WxHNrVKIdb
It’s debate night, so I’ve got my earpiece and performance enhancers ready. https://t.co/EhOiWdjh1b

If we’re elected, @KamalaHarris and I will wake up every single morning to fight for the middle class. For Main Street. For the folks who keep our country running.

We’re going to make our government work for everyone — not just the wealthy and well-connected.
You deserve a president who tells you the truth. https://t.co/YcIMDYZr66
It’s grassroots donors like you who power our campaign. And I’m counting on you to help us meet our end-of-quarter fundraising goal.

If you’re able, please chip in before tomorrow night’s big deadline: https://t.co/JDpr6U0evX
The American people deserve transparency from their leaders, it's why as of today, I've released 22 years of my tax returns. https://t.co/6fwL20fWeI
With casualties rapidly mounting in and around Nagorno-Karabakh, the Trump Administration needs to call the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan immediately to de-escalate the situation. It must also demand others — like Turkey — stay out of this conflict. https://t.co/C41YKEGTyA
I believe there's no greater economic engine in the world than the hard work and ingenuity of the American people — and I witnessed it firsthand last week in Manitowoc, Wisconsin.

Together, we're going to make sure the future is made here in America. https://t.co/tw7tv6sPKT
Folks, this is a big week for our campaign: Tomorrow, I face Donald Trump on the debate stage for the first time — and Wednesday is our final end-of-quarter fundraising deadline.

We can't afford to fall short here. Chip in today: https://t.co/PBlWnV8pBr
.@TheRock is right: Your vote is your voice — and it’s up to all of us to make our voices heard this November.

Make your plan to vote today: https://t.co/eoxT07uII9 https://t.co/qxteF3FjdX
I'm not looking to punish anyone, but it's about time the super-wealthy and corporate America start paying their fair share.
Whether it's $7.50, $75, or $750 — every donation makes a big difference during this final stretch.

Chip in to help us get Donald Trump out of the White House: https://t.co/ttsZXljWG1
President Trump can claim he wants to protect people with pre-existing conditions all he wants — but the fact is he’s fighting tooth and nail to take their protections away.
How much more did you pay in taxes than President Trump?

Head to https://t.co/h9ZZ0iBuiE to find out. https://t.co/w689uVoHq7
Here's the deal: Until we deal with COVID-19, we'll never get our economy fully back on track, get our kids safely back to school, or get our lives back.

It's why as president, I won't waste a day getting this virus under control. https://t.co/xjxsDmKPe3
There's no mystery when it comes to what's happening with the Supreme Court. President Trump and Republicans have been trying to throw out Obamacare for years — and now they see an opening to get it done.

We can't let them get away with it.
On this Gold Star Mother's and Family's Day, Jill and I are keeping the loved ones of our fallen heroes in our prayers. May we never fail to honor them and carry their spirit with us every day.
Jill, Kamala, Doug, and our families all extend our warmest wishes to all who observe Yom Kippur. May you have an easy and meaningful fast. And may you be sealed in the Book of Life. https://t.co/z4EMRDH8Y5
The truth is the economy wasn’t working for folks long before these crises hit. It’s why @KamalaHarris and I won’t just build back to the way things were — we’ll build back better. We won’t be satisfied until the economy starts working for everyone.
The decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court affect our everyday lives — and the American people deserve to have their voices heard when it comes to who serves on the Court. Tune in as I deliver remarks on President Trump’s nomination. https://t.co/N9HmjDXKMw
These folks know that we can’t saddle this country with four more years of Donald Trump. https://t.co/6a3GAHCPyC
Thank you @TheRock for your support at this critical moment for our nation.

You said it best: This election is about earning the respect of the American people. It’s about decency. It’s about electing leaders who tell the truth.

Thanks again, DJ. Next time we’re talking cars. https://t.co/V5kHR5fQbe
In the middle of a pandemic, Donald Trump is trying to force through the confirmation of a Justice who will help him destroy Obamacare.

Health care is at stake. Protections for pre-existing conditions are at stake.

We can't let them win. https://t.co/zIdPmxzYtQ
The Senate shouldn't vote until the American people do.
Supreme Court decisions affect our everyday lives, and the Constitution was designed to give voters a voice on who makes those decisions.

The Senate shouldn't act until after the American people select their next president and the next Congress.

Americans deserve to be heard.
Today, President Trump nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court — a jurist with a written track record of disagreeing with the Court’s decision to uphold the Affordable Care Act.

Vote like your health care is on the ballot — because it is. https://t.co/TDBQOVLP4K
When Ebola hit, President Obama and I took swift action and successfully contained the virus.

After COVID-19 hit, President Trump lied to the American people and said it would miraculously disappear.

Now, over 200,000 lives have been cut short.

It's a national tragedy.
At this moment, we're facing both the worst public health crisis of our lifetime and the existential threat of climate change.

We need a president who believes in science.
Today is Public Lands Day and National Hunting and Fishing Day — and what better way to celebrate than the long overdue removal of William Perry Pendley from @blmnational. It's a victory for everyone who values our public lands over those who want to exploit them for profit. https://t.co/lZxDF4PzH6
If I'm elected, I won't wait to take action on COVID-19.

Minutes after the race is called, I’ll call Dr. Fauci and ask him to stay on.

During my transition, I’ll bring together experts and leaders from both parties to chart a path forward.

We will overcome this, together.
Thanks for a great trip, Minnesota! Don’t forget that early voting is now open across the state. Head to https://t.co/7PghlU2FSm to make your plan to vote today. https://t.co/xRLkPOGwcr
Today, Justice Ginsburg made history one last time — and I was grateful to be there to pay my respects. May her memory be a blessing — and may we continue to be voices for justice in her name. https://t.co/TMJeYw0d89
The unrelenting impact of climate change affects every single one of us.

It requires action, not denial. It requires leadership, not scapegoating.

It requires a president to meet the threshold duty of the office — to care, for everyone.
We are in the middle of a climate emergency — and every day that Donald Trump remains in the White House further threatens the future of our planet.

We have to vote him out. https://t.co/NkSJ7bvBoE
Obamacare was—and is—a big deal. As president, I’ll protect and build on it, lower health care costs, and give Americans the opportunity to choose a new public option.

We’re going to make sure everyone has access to the affordable health care they need. https://t.co/34NCSYhO2C
Health care is a right — not a privilege.
In the middle of a global pandemic, President Trump is trying to get the U.S. Supreme Court to eliminate Obamacare and rip health care protections away from 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions.

Don't forget that.
Thank you, @CindyMcCain. Your support and your friendship mean the world to me. John and I didn't always agree on the issues, but we put aside our differences to find common ground and move the country forward — it's what I'll do every day as president. https://t.co/KheAlsKt73
I've spent my career working to end violence against women and will fight to end the epidemic of missing and murdered indigenous women. I applaud Congress for passing Savanna's Act this week.

Now, the Senate and President Trump need to reauthorize VAWA. It's long overdue. https://t.co/Xru7YzAUBD
Once again, we are called to ask ourselves whether justice could be equally applied in America. But what's clear is that today in America, Black women deserve better.
The Trump Administration says the entire ACA must fall.

They are arguing to strip millions of Americans of health care in the middle of a pandemic.

We can't let him win. https://t.co/bcwiGz1HOn
In-person early voting should be easy and convenient for all. The Flint, MI City Clerk's office will be open the last three weekends before Election Day for folks to cast their ballots. It's an example that cities and states across the country should follow.

Even amidst the profound grief &amp; anger today's decision generated, violence is never &amp; can never be the answer. Those who engage in it must be held accountable. Jill &amp; I are keeping the officers shot tonight in Louisville in our prayers. We wish them both a swift &amp; full recovery.
The 200,000 people we've lost to COVID-19 weren't nobodies, Mr. President.

They were our parents and grandparents, sons and daughters, friends and co-workers.

They were Americans. https://t.co/EcdaEiwgUS

I’ve dealt with guys like Donald Trump my whole life.

Guys who look down on you because they’ve got a lot of money.

Guys who think they’re better than you.

Guys who inherited everything they ever got in life — and then squandered it. https://t.co/o4q5M6VuJC

Donald Trump sees the world from Park Avenue.

I see the world from where I grew up: Scranton, Pennsylvania.
It didn’t have to be this bad. https://t.co/R2WqNeauiu
200,000 Americans have died from this virus.

It’s a staggering number that’s hard to wrap your head around. But behind every COVID-19 death is a family and community that will never again be the same.

There’s a devastating human toll to this pandemic — and we can’t forget that.
While other nations worked around the clock to get this virus under control, our president was too busy tweeting and golfing.

Now, nearly 200,000 Americans have died.

It didn’t have to happen this way. https://t.co/RqdLtARlRW
Today, we'll pass another grim milestone in this pandemic: 200,000 American lives lost.

Jill and I are keeping everyone who's hurting in our prayers. No words can numb your pain, but know the nation grieves with you.

Today is dark, but we will overcome this. Keep the faith.
Donald Trump ran for office saying he would represent the forgotten men and women of this country — and as soon as he got in office, he forgot about us.
When the virus came, President Trump wasn’t thinking about you, he was thinking about his own reelection.

It’s how Trump looks at the world: It’s always about him, never about us.

You deserve a president who will put you first.
Thank you for the warm welcome, Manitowoc! With the help of companies like Wisconsin Aluminum Foundry, we're going to revitalize American manufacturing and make sure the future is made here in America. https://t.co/G2IPTLrhHZ

If this reporting is true, this complaint is deeply concerning and needs to be independently investigated immediately. These women are entitled to be treated with dignity and respect. Practices like this would end in a Biden Administration. https://t.co/Yrf3qW5f7E

I’m Joe Biden and I approve this message. https://t.co/TuRZXPE5xK
We must win.
The Supreme Court is on the ballot. And the outcome will impact everything from health care to civil rights — affecting generations to come. 

Vote. Our future depends on it. https://t.co/Hy8C4mIL2M
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg fought for all of us. She was a giant of the Court and unflinching in her pursuit of equal justice under the law. Because of her life’s work, we are closer to that more perfect union we’ve always strived to be. https://t.co/o30ZCuj10G
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg inspired us all. https://t.co/vQQiB1oQ2J
Let me be clear: The voters should pick a President, and that President should select a successor to Justice Ginsburg.
Ruth Bader Ginsburg stood for all of us. She was an American hero, a giant of legal doctrine, and a relentless voice in the pursuit of that highest American ideal: Equal Justice Under Law. May her memory be a blessing to all people who cherish our Constitution and its promise.
Jill and I wish our friends in the Jewish community a very healthy and happy New Year. As we mark this new beginning, let us commit to pursuing peace and justice in the year ahead. #RoshHashanah

When we needed Donald Trump to tell the truth about COVID-19, he lied to us.

When we needed him to take action to contain its spread, he spent his days golfing.

When we needed a president the most, he was nowhere to be found.

It's unforgivable.
Donald Trump claimed he would be the greatest jobs president God ever created.

But the fact is he's the worst jobs president in recorded history.

We can't afford another four years of his failed leadership. https://t.co/uW10KJhMsV

Donald Trump wants to give his rich friends another tax cut, so they pay a lower tax rate than tens of millions of essential workers and middle class Americans.

The 100 richest Americans have made more than $300 billion during the COVID-19 crisis.
 
Now, in the middle of a pandemic and economic crisis, Donald Trump wants to give them a $29 billion tax break.
 
Let that sink in.
If you make under $400,000, you will not pay a penny more in taxes when I'm president.

The super-wealthy and big corporations will finally pay their fair share — and we'll invest that money in working families.

We're going to reward work — not wealth.
.@realDonaldTrump, the job is to be president of all Americans. For the love of God start acting like it. https://t.co/kkHf9aWZmR
We've had to endure President Trump's incompetence and dishonesty when it comes to testing, wearing masks, and socially distancing. 
 
We can't afford a repeat of those fiascos with a COVID-19 vaccine.

The stakes are too high.
Yesterday, I met with some of our nation's top experts to discuss how we distribute a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine. If I win this election, I know that there won't be a minute to waste. I'll get to work on day one implementing an effective distribution plan. https://t.co/GfgSnBwjTQ
President Trump promised the opioid crisis would end quickly if he won, but the fact is drug overdose deaths are up nearly 10% across the country. It's heartbreaking.

We all want a COVID-19 vaccine as soon as possible, but it needs to be based on science — not politics. Tune in as I discuss how we can develop and equitably distribute a safe and effective vaccine: https://t.co/KPxTaqAiVd
We’ve lost nearly 200,000 Americans to COVID-19. 

It didn’t have to be this bad — but Donald Trump failed to do his job.
The fact of the matter is Donald Trump doesn't have a health care plan.

I do — and you can read it here: https://t.co/gm6jgUrcaT https://t.co/LbvDvFj4m8
Science will win. https://t.co/1KRipY9MCi
Donald Trump’s climate denial may not have directly caused the record fires we’re seeing on the West Coast. But if he gets four more years in the White House, they’ll only become more common, devastating, and deadly. https://t.co/7rsG9VDZ4w
To be clear: I am not currently president. But if you chip in now, we can change that in November: https://t.co/eFS4tDfHEx https://t.co/ciqFcIGLHB
Hispanic Heritage Month is a reminder of the strength we draw as a nation from our immigrant roots. No matter where your family came from, we're here because we all share the same ideals. That's the story of America — and it is well worth celebrating. https://t.co/rign44stJc
Donald Trump not only suggested we sell or trade Puerto Rico — but he also left our fellow Americans without the resources they desperately needed after Hurricane Maria. It's unacceptable.

As president, I'll support the island's full recovery and invest in its people and future.
Today marks the official start of Hispanic Heritage Month. Tune in as we kick off our celebration from Florida: https://t.co/GMSo25KzM6
As we celebrate the Independence Day of Costa Rica, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua, we must affirm the democratic aspirations and human rights of people across Latin America.

I'll always fight for democracy and for those who come to America seeking a better life.
The 16th Street Baptist Church bombing is a powerful reminder of our past and what remains at stake in this election. As we honor the memory of those four little girls, we must commit to defeating the poisonous ideology of white supremacy that lit the fuse 57 years ago.
I believe that every American deserves a fair shot to get ahead and a government that treats them equally. But that hasn't been the case for the people of Puerto Rico. Today, I'm releasing my new plan to change that: https://t.co/qX7sQPPfmX
For months, President Trump has failed to provide desperately needed fiscal relief to our state and local governments — and we’re seeing the consequences every day.

I promise that as president, I’ll make reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act a top priority and continue working to end gender-based violence. https://t.co/wmN7bSAUVg
With each reauthorization, VAWA has become stronger.

The latest bill—passed by the House last year—would close loopholes allowing abusers to obtain guns and extend protections for Native women.

But Mitch McConnell refuses to bring it to the floor for a vote. It’s despicable.
26 years ago today, the Violence Against Women Act became law. In the years since, it has saved countless lives and helped change the culture around sexual assault and domestic violence.

Writing and championing the law remains one of my proudest accomplishments. https://t.co/9pV7X9fgKq
It's hard to believe, but Monday marks 50 days until Election Day. To kick off the final stretch, @HillaryClinton and @KamalaHarris are hosting a grassroots fundraiser.

You won't want to miss this, folks. Chip in to reserve your spot: https://t.co/WI4clZqxEA
26 years ago today, the Senate passed 10-year bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines—it was an effort I was proud to champion.

These bans saved lives, and Congress should have never let them expire.

As president, I’ll take on the @NRA and we’ll ban them once again.
This cold-blooded shooting is unconscionable and the perpetrator must be brought to justice.

Violence of any kind is wrong; those who commit it should be caught and punished.

Donald Trump and I have pretty different philosophies when it comes to giving our word.

Iran’s cruel execution of Navid Afkari is a travesty. No country should arrest, torture, or execute peaceful protestors or activists. 

Iran must free its other political prisoners, including Nasrin Sotoudeh, and release unjustly detained Americans. https://t.co/Jj9QZbyQL7
As president, I’ll impose a tax penalty on companies that ship jobs overseas and sell products back to the U.S. — and I’ll create millions of good-paying jobs here at home.

We’re going to make sure the future is made in America — by all of America's workers. https://t.co/8smOm5MGx1

You deserve a President and Vice President who will spend every minute of every day working to make your life better.

I promise that’s exactly what @KamalaHarris and I will do.
Always remember. https://t.co/BwaBSo8LFq
And now, as then, we owe it to them to come together as a nation — so that Americans can once again do what we did so bravely nineteen years ago: turn from tragedy to purpose, rebuild our lives, and begin, in time, to heal.
Now, as then, our heroes are ordinary people doing extraordinary things: nurses and doctors; delivery drivers and grocery clerks; public transit workers and educators; regular Americans thrust into courageous acts of sacrifice and service.
This year, we mark the anniversary of 9/11 in the midst of another crisis that compels us to summon the best of the American people in the face of unconscionable, inconceivable loss — a crisis that has already taken nearly 200,000 Americans.
Nineteen years ago, our nation was tested by an unspeakable act of cowardice and hate. Nearly 3,000 lives were cut short: a once-unthinkable toll which tore open the hearts of Americans in every corner of the country. https://t.co/6rAF0dAd1Y
As a nation, we must never forget those we lost on 9/11 and the incredible bravery of our first responders. Though the wounds of that day will never fully heal, the spirit of Americans recovered as it always does — unbowed by the efforts of those who strike against it. https://t.co/Ogn7Sbvq1Q
Donald Trump said he wanted to be a cheerleader for the country. We didn't need a cheerleader. We needed a president.

Donald Trump is holding a rally in Michigan today—while also refusing to fully fund their National Guard.

These are frontline workers against COVID-19, responsible for testing and distributing food and medical supplies.

Do your part. Wear a mask. https://t.co/pdnEecS49Q

How many more people have to suffer because of President Trump's lies? https://t.co/m2spzGCKgd
Donald Trump said he didn't want to tell the truth and create a panic. So he did nothing and created a disaster.
I got to meet Lou Brock back in March. I joked that I had really just come to St. Louis to see him—and let me tell you, our meeting was a real highlight. Lou was a true legend and a man of integrity. Jill and I are keeping his loved ones in our prayers during this difficult time. https://t.co/ZStoBAnk7V
Donald Trump knew that COVID-19 was dangerous. He knew it was deadly. And he purposely downplayed it.

Now, nearly 200,000 Americans are dead.

It’s unconscionable. https://t.co/SLqqhmWy8E
You deserve a president who tells you the truth.
If Donald Trump had acted just two weeks earlier, 54,000 lives could have been spared in March and April alone. 

Instead, he downplayed the threat and refused to take action — costing lives and sending our economy into a tailspin.

It’s an unjustifiable dereliction of duty.
Roberto Clemente was an incredible baseball player. He was a barrier breaker and a humanitarian. As he rose to fame, he lifted the Black and Latino communities with him.

I promise you that if I’m elected, I’ll always tell you the truth.

I’ll listen to the experts and do everything I can to contain this virus.

And I’ll always put your health and safety first — no matter the political cost.
Donald Trump knew.

He lied to us for months.

And while a deadly disease ripped through our nation, he failed to do his job — on purpose.

It was a life or death betrayal of the American people. https://t.co/WDmVUvmmJk

Donald Trump squandered it — and hardworking Michiganders are paying the price every day. https://t.co/kXjyPbsj8s
Given his track record, no one can take Trump’s word alone on a COVID-19 vaccine. But with satisfactory answers to these questions, every American can have confidence in a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine. https://t.co/074K1HD9wf
3: What is the plan to allocate and distribute vaccines to Americans cost-free, safely, equitably, and without politics?
 
President Trump should release a detailed distribution plan to ensure every American — not just the wealthy and well-connected — receives the vaccine.
2: Who will validate that the Administration’s decision to greenlight a COVID-19 vaccine is driven by science and not political motivation?
 
We must hear uncensored statements on efficacy and safety from @FDACBER, the @US_FDA vaccine advisory committee, and Dr. Fauci.
A safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine could save countless lives. We need one as soon as possible.

But while I see a vaccine as a product of science, President Trump sees it as a political tool.

Politics should play no role in this. The Administration must answer the following:
Donald Trump is incapable of providing the leadership this moment requires.
Every single American worker deserves the chance to join a union. As president, I’ll strengthen our labor unions and ensure workers can bargain for the pay, benefits, and workplace protections they deserve. https://t.co/Yqd8D5SzbQ

Just months ago, Donald Trump was planning to allow oil and gas drilling off the coast of Florida.

This economy may be working great for Donald Trump and his wealthy friends — but it's not working for the rest of America.

It's time we change that.
At our best, America has always been generous, kind, and optimistic. We treat each other with dignity, give hate no safe harbor, and leave no one behind.

I believe we can be that nation once again.
Mr. President — If you’re so good at making deals, then why does your trade deal cost American workers so much pain while letting China off the hook for its biggest trade abuses? https://t.co/mL8a67CTAw
As president, I’ll make record investments in American industry and create millions of good-paying, union jobs.

We’re going to make sure the future is made in America — and built by union workers. https://t.co/rt5RD9Fdi0
Wall Street didn't build this country — the middle class did. And unions built the middle class.

Donald Trump doesn't understand that. We need a president who does.
It's not enough to just thank our essential workers — we need to pay them. As president, I’ll:

- Raise the minimum wage to $15
- End the tipped minimum wage
- End the sub-minimum wage for people with disabilities
- Ensure everyone has strong benefits
For years, President Trump and Republicans have waged a war on America's labor unions. 

It will end on my watch.

I'll sign the PRO Act — making it easier for workers to organize and collectively bargain — and be the strongest labor president workers have ever had.
Together, we can build a future that reflects working people’s courage and ambition. One that not only offers good jobs — but the dignity, equity, shared prosperity, and common purpose due to every American. https://t.co/FDLGMKCgWD
The 40-hour workweek
Minimum wage
Overtime pay
Health care 
Workplace safety protections

They’re all because of unions — and it’s time we recognize that.
Today, we honor the generations of union workers who fought for the rights, power, wages, and benefits that built and sustained the great American middle class. #LaborDay https://t.co/gTqE9tYUKd
We need to restore honor and decency to the White House.

Donald Trump promised to be the greatest jobs president God ever created.

But in reality, he's on track to become the first president in modern history to leave office with fewer jobs than when he entered.

The economy wasn’t working for folks long before this virus hit. That’s why @KamalaHarris and I won’t just build back to the way things were — we’re going to build back better.

We’re going to make sure everyone has a fair shot to get ahead. https://t.co/rt5RD9Fdi0
As president, I will:

- Call for nationwide mask mandates
- Implement widespread testing
- Accelerate the development of treatments and vaccines

I’m ready to work on day one to contain the spread of this virus and get our country back on track.
Nicaraguan asylum seekers fleeing oppression deserve to have their cases heard. Instead, they’re being deported back into the tyrannical grip of Daniel Ortega without a chance to pursue their claims.

Every day Donald Trump proves how morally unfit he is to lead our nation.

In 60 days, we have to vote him out. https://t.co/EteeruIOm6
Now is not the time for a victory lap, Mr. President. Just because your wealthy friends and donors are doing well doesn't mean everyone else is.

Get off the golf course. Call the leaders of Congress to the White House. And make a deal that delivers for working people.
The fact is we're more than six months into this pandemic, and:

- 11.5 million Americans don't have their jobs back
- Almost 30 million are on unemployment
- We're down 720,000 manufacturing jobs
- Nearly 1 in 6 small businesses have closed their doors
I'm grateful for everyone who found work in August and found that glimmer of hope — but there is real cause for concern in this morning's jobs report.

The pace of job gains in August was slower than in July. And significantly slower than May or June.

Donald Trump keeps telling us if he was president, you'd feel safe.

Well, he is president — whether he knows it or not.
Trump and Pence are running on this: “You won’t be safe in Joe Biden’s America.”

And what’s their proof?

The violence you’re seeing in Donald Trump’s America.
The simple truth is Donald Trump failed to protect America. So now, he’s trying to scare America.
I want a safe America — safe from COVID, safe from crime and looting, safe from racially motivated violence, safe from bad cops. 

And let’s be crystal clear: Safe from four more years of Donald Trump.
Donald Trump may believe mouthing the words law and order makes him strong, but his failure to call on his own supporters to stop acting as an armed militia in this country shows you how weak he is.
Donald Trump can’t stop the violence we're seeing today – because for years he has fomented it.  Tune in as I discuss the need for justice and safety in America: https://t.co/gSXuP0jc5D
Does anyone believe there will be less violence in America if Donald Trump is reelected?
We are facing so many crises under Donald Trump:
 
COVID.
Economic devastation.
Unwarranted police violence.
Emboldened white nationalists.
A reckoning on race.
Declining faith in a bright American future.

The common thread? A president who makes things worse — not better.
We’re going to build back better and we will do it while creating a brighter future for you and your families. This week @KamalaHarris and I sit down to discuss how we are going to move forward—together.

Join us on Tuesday. https://t.co/hebSifEEHL
There’s a lot happening, but I hope we don’t overlook the brave fire fighters &amp; emergency responders in the wake of Hurricane Laura.

When the storm hit, they stayed behind—even while their homes were being destroyed—to help their community recover.

True American heroes.
This video is doctored — and a flagrant attempt to spread misinformation at the expense of a man who uses assistive technology. 

It should be removed. Now. https://t.co/Bnv5H2NhZT

Donald Trump has been president for almost four years.

The temperature in the country is higher, tensions run stronger, divisions run deeper.

And all of us are less safe because he can’t do the job of the American president.
We must not become a country at war with ourselves.

A country that accepts the killing of fellow Americans who do not agree with you. A country that vows vengeance toward one another.

But that is the America that President Trump wants us to be, the America he believes we are.
The deadly violence we saw overnight in Portland is unacceptable. Shooting in the streets of a great American city is unacceptable.

I condemn violence of every kind by anyone, whether on the left or the right. And I challenge Donald Trump to do the same. https://t.co/JRuI7ya2Wv
We run this campaign led by the values that guide my life - honesty, integrity, and compassion. @KamalaHarris and I are hard at work and want to let you into the conversation.

Join us this Tuesday. https://t.co/zu0QDka23i
No lies, fear-mongering, or malarkey.

Just an honest conversation about the future of our nation.

Tune in this Tuesday. https://t.co/yWc0ewazL4
I believe we're so much better than what we saw this week at the RNC.

This is our moment to choose love over hate, hope over fear, fact over fiction.

We'll overcome this era of American darkness, together. https://t.co/QEMvt14wG8
I don’t know a single person who believes any part of this pandemic has been a “good thing.

The true power of @ChadwickBoseman was bigger than anything we saw on screen. From the Black Panther to Jackie Robinson, he inspired generations and showed them they can be anything they want — even super heroes. Jill and I are praying for his loved ones at this difficult time.
America was built on a simple idea: All men — and women — are created equal. 

It’s time we ensured all people are treated equally as well.
The President incites violence, inspires white-supremacist shooters, and his failed COVID response is costing thousands of lives per day. When you look at the world right now, ask yourself: Do you feel safe in Trump’s America? https://t.co/Ztp6TdSwKk
America is at an inflection point.

The calls for racial justice that sparked the March on Washington 57 years ago are ringing out again today.

As we honor the legacy of that day — let's meet this moment with the urgency and action that our heroes marched for half a century ago. https://t.co/Bs0SccjnxN
Donald Trump put our nation on the sidelines. Let’s get back in the game. https://t.co/e8VsW5IsNi
I know from personal experience how important access to quality, affordable health care is for a family. I know the peace of mind it brings.

It's why as president, I promise I'll protect your children's health care as if they were my own. https://t.co/kqiKt8ISXj
As we mark the 57th anniversary of the March on Washington and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s I Have a Dream speech, we must continue the hard work of perfecting our union. It's up to all of us to carry on the march toward equality, liberty, and justice for all.
We can't let George Floyd and Jacob Blake become just another pair of hashtags.

This is a moment of action.

It's long past time we reform policing, reverse systemic racism, and make our communities safer.
Times of crisis often bring out our best as Americans — and we're seeing that right now in the aftermath of Hurricane Laura. Thank you to all of our emergency responders who are working around the clock to help people get back on their feet. https://t.co/uwhq4dDgwO
Tonight is yet another reminder of what's at stake in this election.

Remember: every example of violence Donald Trump decries has happened on his watch. Under his leadership. During his presidency.
Leadership requires foresight. https://t.co/qTdtIPYM8m
From the moment COVID-19 emerged, President Trump downplayed the threat it posed, refused to listen to the experts, and failed to take action to contain its spread.

Now, we’re paying the price.
Donald Trump promised to be the greatest jobs president God ever created.

Instead, tens of millions of Americans are out of work and we're facing the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. #PromisesBroken https://t.co/JzjZu7KKRr
Donald Trump didn't build a wall around America, the world built a wall around us. https://t.co/lLY8S92cSb
Donald Trump is right, this is the most important election in the history of our country.

Chip in to help us get him out of the White House: https://t.co/1Ve0clLACI
Donald Trump calls himself a wartime president. But now, instead of leading the charge to defeat this virus, he’s waved the white flag.

He abandoned the American people when we needed him most.
When President Trump took office, he inherited a growing economy from the Obama-Biden administration. And just like everything else he’s inherited in his life, he squandered it. https://t.co/tTBD8lRC1c
President Trump has failed our nation. https://t.co/w792IB79kK
- 180,000 lives lost
- Nearly 6 million confirmed cases of COVID-19
- Over 25 million Americans out of work
- Countless small businesses on the brink of closing

That's Donald Trump's America. We're living it every day. We can't take four more years.
When Donald Trump says tonight you won’t be safe in Joe Biden’s America, look around and ask yourself: How safe do you feel in Donald Trump’s America?
This news is deeply disturbing — as an alum of @UDelaware and as an American. We need a full and swift investigation into what happened Tuesday night.
 
With anti-Semitism on the rise across the country, we all have a moral obligation to speak out and give hate no safe harbor. https://t.co/YofvhFv6wA
President Trump doesn’t want a second term. He wants a do-over.

As he takes the stage tonight, remember: he alone is responsible for the chaos in our country.

Together, we can stop it. https://t.co/iKcrLuEC9N
Donald Trump and Republicans must have forgotten about the 180,000 American lives lost due to COVID-19.

Or we can choose a different path — one of hope, unity, and light.

Let's overcome this era of darkness, together: https://t.co/agUqzkqkXT
180,000 people have died from this COVID crisis. And the heartbreaking truth is that it didn't have to happen this way.
This moment demands moral leadership. And these players answered by standing up, speaking out, and using their platform for good.

100 years ago today, the 19th Amendment was certified, giving some women the right to vote.

A good step forward. Yet President Trump continues to do everything he can to dismantle the Affordable Care Act.

I will defend the rights of all Americans to have access to quality, affordable health care, free from discrimination.

Tonight we saw that Americans are ready to come together, and that we the people can overcome these crises and emerge stronger than ever.

If we have any hope of ending this chaos, we have got to vote for Joe Biden like our lives depend on it.

Donald Trump is the wrong president for our country. He has had more than enough time to prove that he can do the job, but he is clearly in over his head...it is what it is.

#DemConvention https://t.co/OArXv15lVV
A president's words have the power to move markets. They can start wars or broker peace. They can summon our better angels or awaken our worst instincts. You simply cannot fake your way through this job.

#DemConvention https://t.co/ZH1EDg28Al
The leaders who ran in the 2020 primary with me represent the best of America. They made me a better candidate, and they make us a better nation. 

I am proud to have their support. Together, we will defeat Donald Trump. #DemConvention https://t.co/BOztd8iR0b
“Out of many, Americans are one.” — @AmyKlobuchar #DemConvention https://t.co/88d1V3kPmk
Governor @GretchenWhitmer — thank you for your support and for meeting the COVID-19 crisis with the urgency it demands. The people of Michigan are lucky to have you leading the way. #DemConvention https://t.co/ef2d4DldRV
I believe that Americans have more in common than what divides us. 

I couldn't agree more. What we need to do in both Alabama and Washington is to bring folks together. @DougJones knows that in his core. #DemConvention https://t.co/EIoZDW8ucw
If we want to build back better and deliver real change for the American people, then we've got to flip the U.S. Senate. And the path to doing so runs right through Maine. Thank you, @SaraGideon for being with us tonight. #DemConvention https://t.co/1eyIpC81vC

Just imagine where we would be right now if we had a president who listened to the scientists.
Secretary Esper and President Trump, it's a president's job to protect the health and safety of our troops and their families. Gutting the military health care system — no less during a global pandemic — is unacceptable. https://t.co/lXpcSdm8au
There are only 78 days until Election Day — and @KamalaHarris and I need your help to make Donald Trump a one-term president.

The hard truth is that our economy wasn't working for folks long before this crisis. It's why we can't just go back to the way things were — we have to build back better. 

We've got to create an economy that works for everyone — not just the wealthy and well-connected.
As Attorney General of the largest state in the country, @KamalaHarris took on the big banks over mortgage fraud, and Big Oil when they wanted to pollute without consequences.

She's the kind of fighter I need alongside me in the White House.
Here’s my promise to you: If I’m elected president, I will always choose to unite rather than divide. 

I’ll take responsibility instead of blaming others. 

I’ll never forget that the job isn’t about me — it’s about you.
Donald Trump and Congress need to act now to deliver the relief the American people need. https://t.co/YhlPXPspcS
The United States of America can be defined by one word: possibilities. There’s not a single thing we can’t achieve if we set our minds to it. https://t.co/vASpxmaD3E
I’m trying to get my miles in before the Secret Service stops me. https://t.co/2PFwO7bjSA
.@KamalaHarris is smart, tough, and experienced. She knows how to govern and make the hard calls.

She's ready to hit the ground running on day one.
We need nationwide mask mandates.
Mr. President, Jill and I are sad to learn of your younger brother Robert’s passing. I know the tremendous pain of losing a loved one — and I know how important family is in moments like these. I hope you know that our prayers are with you all.
We can meet the challenge of COVID-19 and turn the corner on this pandemic. We just need a president and vice president ready and willing to lead. https://t.co/HqfHD0qB4y
.@KamalaHarris has spent her entire life fighting for what’s right — and I know she’ll continue that fight when we get to the White House. https://t.co/EgGuiaKKpC
William Perry Pendley has no business working at @blmnational and I'm happy to see his nomination to lead it withdrawn. In a Biden Administration, folks who spend their careers selling off public lands won't get anywhere near being tapped to protect them. https://t.co/a0GsuoCVpn
This was a big week for our campaign: @KamalaHarris joined me on the ticket and we had our best fundraising week yet. Together, we are building the coalition that will beat Donald Trump.

Chip in if you’re able to keep the momentum going: https://t.co/MIxfjbChaW
I know a thing or two about being Vice President — and I know @KamalaHarris is the best partner I could have for the fight ahead.
Come January, there won’t be any time to waste repairing the damage of the last four years and beginning the work of building back better.

@KamalaHarris and I are ready to get to work on day one. https://t.co/xEkEVwTHs6
Donald Trump has had a lot of failures in his career, but he knows how to do one thing well: inherit something great and squander it. And never take any responsibility. https://t.co/mDTSFogeUW

We’ve got to protect and expand Social Security — I’ll get it done as President. https://t.co/hnkhh6I1ar
I know just how important Social Security is for countless Americans. That's why as president, I'll protect and strengthen it — not defund it.
This afternoon, @KamalaHarris and I filled out our paperwork to get on the ballot in November.

Now, we're counting on you to do your part to make sure you're set to vote.

Get registered today: https://t.co/Hy8C4mIL2M https://t.co/JzAonY8TCg
The fate of Social Security is on the ballot in November. As President, I will never, ever defund Social Security. I’ll strengthen it.

Anything less is a failure of a president’s most important duty: to care for the American people. https://t.co/1GaFbdd6u7
People are losing their homes. Millions have already lost their paychecks. Our country is in crisis.

The virus isn’t taking a break — Republicans shouldn’t either. The House did their job. President Trump, bring the Senate back and pass a relief bill. Now.
What kind of president tries to defund Social Security during an economic crisis? https://t.co/FO47IjABTF
Voting by mail is safe and secure. And don't take my word for it:
Take it from the President, who just requested his mail-in ballot for the Florida primary on Tuesday.
Today marks 85 years since the Social Security Act was signed into law, providing protection for the most vulnerable. Now we’re living in a moment where we must strengthen our commitment to Social Security — not defund it.
The choice we make this November will decide the future of America.

I have no doubt @KamalaHarris is the right partner to join me to lead our nation through this moment. https://t.co/YdJFksiCrI
82 days. https://t.co/scZvNK1ZnQ
.@KamalaHarris is going to stand with me in this campaign — and all of us are going to stand up for her.

There’s no better partner than @KamalaHarris to help me beat Donald Trump, but we can’t do it without your help.

The hard truth is Black women still only get paid 62 cents for every dollar white men make. It's unacceptable.

My administration will work to close the pay gap for Black women and create an economy where everyone gets a fair return for their work. #BlackWomensEqualPayDay https://t.co/UTADOjULxF
I know @KamalaHarris will work every single day to make life better for all Americans and build this nation back better than before. https://t.co/8hTslszBPC
I first met @KamalaHarris through my son Beau. They grew close while fighting to take on the big banks — and he had enormous respect for her and her work.

There is no one’s opinion I valued more than Beau’s, and I’m proud to have Kamala standing with me on this campaign.
.@DrBiden and I are keeping the people of Iowa and everyone impacted by Monday's derecho in our prayers. We've got to make sure Iowans and those across the midwest get the relief they need for a quick and full recovery. https://t.co/nsPQUKDbp2
When I was making my decision, I knew I needed someone who’s ready to help lead the nation on day one.

@KamalaHarris is that person. https://t.co/7PZUupy8Dm
We are in a battle for the soul of this nation. And if we're going to get through these crises — we need to come together and unite for a better America.

@KamalaHarris gets that — and I believe there's no better person to help me get the job done.
When I called @KamalaHarris yesterday to ask her to be my running mate, I wanted to make sure Jill and Doug got to say hello. 

You’re honorary Bidens now! https://t.co/IILUjB6WfY
Heather Heyer was a brave young woman who saw what was happening in her hometown of Charlottesville and decided to fight against it. 

Let us honor her memory by continuing to stand against hate.
Three years ago today, white supremacists descended on Charlottesville with torches in hand and hate in their hearts. Our president said they were very fine people.
 
It was clear then, and it's clear now: We are in a battle for the soul of our nation, and we must win.
Let's get to work, @KamalaHarris. https://t.co/EjtUpgaieI
One of the reasons I chose @KamalaHarris is because we both believe you can define America in one simple word — possibilities.
If you’re worried about whether you’ll have a job, worried about the poisons in the air you breathe and water you drink, worried about your civil rights or even your basic dignity being under attack—@KamalaHarris has had your back. Now, we have to have hers.
Working families need someone on their side...because they certainly don’t have anyone on their side with this president.
 
That’s going to change in the Biden-Harris administration.
This morning, little girls woke up across this nation — especially Black and Brown girls who so often may feel overlooked and undervalued in our society — potentially seeing themselves in a new way: As the stuff of Presidents and Vice Presidents.
We’ve all watched @KamalaHarris in the Senate go toe-to-toe with Trump officials trying to hide the truth, asking the tough questions that need to be asked — and not stopping until she gets an answer. She’s ready to do this job.
This afternoon, @KamalaHarris and I will be speaking together for the first time since yesterday’s big announcement. Tune in: https://t.co/xoRbSqGta8
Whether it's taking on the big banks or pushing for marriage equality—Kamala never shies away from fighting tooth and nail for what's right. It's why I chose her to be my running mate.

She'll wake up every day thinking about how to make life better for the people of our country.
As the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, @KamalaHarris grew up believing in the promise of America because she saw it firsthand.

Together, Kamala and I are going to fight every single day in the White House to make sure that promise is fulfilled for all Americans.
If @KamalaHarris and I are elected, we’re going to inherit multiple crises, a nation divided, and a world in disarray. We won’t have a minute to waste.
 
That's exactly why I picked her: She's ready to lead on day one.
.@KamalaHarris is the daughter of proud immigrants—a mother from India and a father from Jamaica—who raised her to take action.
That’s exactly what this moment calls for: action. And we hope you’ll take action with us: https://t.co/K3mVwfTxXJ https://t.co/MZLAx9IN6C
Right now, America faces: 
 
- The worst pandemic in 100 years
- The worst economic crisis since the Great Depression
- The most powerful calls for racial justice in a generation
 
I need someone alongside me who's smart, tough, and ready to lead. @KamalaHarris is that person.
Thanks to supporters like you, we are on track to have our biggest fundraising day ever. Together, we can win this.

Join us. https://t.co/B7uyMcat6n
Let’s go win this, @KamalaHarris. https://t.co/O2EYo6rYyk
Back when Kamala was Attorney General, she worked closely with Beau. I watched as they took on the big banks, lifted up working people, and protected women and kids from abuse. I was proud then, and I'm proud now to have her as my partner in this campaign.
I have the great honor to announce that I’ve picked @KamalaHarris — a fearless fighter for the little guy, and one of the country’s finest public servants — as my running mate.
Don't forget that in the middle of this pandemic, the Trump Administration is in court trying to eliminate Obamacare and rip health insurance away from millions. It's heartless.

I'll protect and build on the ACA to ensure everyone gets the care they need. https://t.co/IwFG48ED9h
I promise you if I'm elected, I won't waste any time getting this virus under control.

I'll call Dr. Fauci and ask him to stay on. I'll bring together top experts and leaders from both parties to chart a path forward.

We'll get it done, together.
Social Security is the bedrock of American retirement — giving countless Americans peace of mind and the ability to retire with dignity. I've been fighting to protect and expand the program throughout my career — and I'll continue that fight as president.
Folks, we need to listen to our frontline heroes. Wear a mask. It’s not just about you. It’s about keeping your family, neighbors, and fellow citizens safe. https://t.co/pbI6UVhqvh
Bristol Bay is no place for a mine — our administration decided that in 2014. We're only discussing it today because Donald Trump's EPA reversed course hours after a closed-door meeting with the mining company's CEO. https://t.co/RG38v0dRDk
Donald Trump said that if he’s re-elected, he’ll defund Social Security.

We can't let that happen.
President Trump keeps attacking the U.S. Postal Service, and now hundreds of thousands of veterans aren't getting their life-saving medications on time. It's despicable.

I promise you that as president, I will never put politics over the care of our nation's veterans. https://t.co/aXryhxVRtG
To the millions of Americans struggling to get by right now — those who can't find a job or pay the bills: I want you to know that I see you, and I won't forget you — and I'm going to fight every day in the White House to build an economy that works for you.
Every single eligible American should have the opportunity to vote-by-mail this November. If it's good enough for Donald Trump — then it's good enough for you and me.
We can’t let Donald Trump destroy the U.S. Postal Service.
It's been six years since Michael Brown's life was taken in Ferguson — reigniting a movement. We must continue the work of tackling systemic racism and reforming policing.
Our planet can’t take four more years of Donald Trump. We have to get him out of the White House so we can start treating the climate crisis like the urgent threat it is.
Giving the Trump administration another four years in office would have catastrophic implications for future generations. His victory would threaten the future of our democracy, and we must vote him out this November. https://t.co/iIFPTIB1Er
The United States just passed 5 million reported infections of COVID-19. It’s a number that boggles the mind and breaks the heart. Each time the number goes up, it represents a life altered, a family stricken with anxiety, a community on edge. It shouldn’t have gotten this bad.
Today, Donald Trump stated that if re-elected, he'll undermine the entire financial footing of Social Security.

Our seniors and millions of Americans with disabilities are under enough stress without their hard-earned Social Security benefits in doubt. https://t.co/glUDQlcbEO
Donald Trump has refused to take serious action to combat the COVID-19 crisis. And as a result, he got what he’s always wanted — the U.S. isolated from the rest of the world. https://t.co/owvNL4ul74
It’s an important choice, and I want you to be one of the first to know who I’ve picked as my running mate – text FIRST to 30330 to get notified when I’ve made my decision.
Between the coronavirus and the economic crisis, this is a tough time for our country, I know. But I firmly believe that our best days still lie ahead. Together, we will climb out of these crises and emerge stronger than before.
The fact is, Donald Trump left our nation unprepared and unprotected for the worst public health crisis of our lifetime — and we're paying the price every single day. https://t.co/sZJCdivRo3
Our nation is desperate for leadership — leadership that can unite us and steer us through these crises. But at the most critical moment of his presidency, Donald Trump has nothing to offer.
No President can promise to prevent future outbreaks. But I'll promise you this: when I'm President we will prepare better, respond better, and recover better.
John Lewis will be remembered as a moral giant who dedicated his life to creating a more just, equal, and moral America.

Donald Trump will not. https://t.co/vfZFeCUX3S
I can’t believe I have to say this, but we can’t let Donald Trump open up the Grand Canyon for uranium mining.
I believe every American deserves a fair shot at success — not just the Mar-a-Lago crowd. That’s why as president, I’ll reverse Donald Trump’s giant tax giveaways to the super-wealthy and big corporations, and build an economy that works for everyone.
It didn't have to be this bad. https://t.co/xwdxgizLLH
Here’s the truth—Donald Trump turned his back on the middle class long before COVID-19. He cut taxes for the super-wealthy, drove U.S. manufacturing into a recession, and stacked the deck against hardworking Americans.

It's time we pick a different path. https://t.co/rt5RD9WOGA
Make no mistake: This economic crisis is due to President Trump’s failure to get this virus under control. https://t.co/CBbk6SV39Q
While I am grateful for the people who got their jobs back, my heart goes out to the more than 16 million Americans still out of work. The truth is it didn't have to be this bad, but Donald Trump failed to act. He's the one person who should lose his job. https://t.co/eIHGRjwJd3
The truth is that President Trump could have acted months ago to curb this pandemic—it's obvious he still hasn’t learned his lesson. He continues to ignore the warnings of health experts and we're all paying the price. https://t.co/JOgA5Gpop4
Here’s how COVID-19 affected Arizonans under the Trump—Ducey model:

- An infection rate—still—of nearly 20%
- The fifth-highest number of current hospitalizations in the country
- More than 4,000 deaths from COVID-19
- More than 183,000 cases
- Lengthy delays in test results
Gov. Ducey is rushing reopening without adequate testing and contact tracing.

He’s withholding support for increased testing and making local leaders plead for it.

He’s refusing to implement a mask mandate and turning his back on older Americans and those at greater risk.
President Trump called Arizona “a model for applying a science-based approach to the decreasing cases and hospitalizations without implementing a punishing lockdown.” He said Governor Ducey’s approach should be used by other states—but here’s what’s really happening in Arizona:
My commitment to you is this: I will always listen, I will never stop fighting for the African American community and I will never stop fighting for a more equitable future.
Throughout my career I've witnessed the diversity of thought, background, and sentiment within the African American community. It's this diversity that makes our workplaces, communities, and country a better place.
Earlier today, I made some comments about diversity in the African American and Latino communities that I want to clarify. In no way did I mean to suggest the African American community is a monolith—not by identity, not on issues, not at all.
I believe that the right to vote is the most fundamental American right there is. To protect it, we’ve got to:

- Pass the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act
- Enact automatic and same-day voter registration
- Stand up to Republican voter suppression efforts
John Lewis left us with marching orders. It’s up to all of us to carry them out: https://t.co/Hy8C4mIL2M https://t.co/MTc6WHNnSR
Every moment with your loved ones is precious. I know that in my core because I’ve learned it through loss. It's why as president, I'm going to do everything I can to get this virus under control and get our lives back to normal as soon as we can. https://t.co/qCsvryHMai
Let me be clear: Voting is a right — not a privilege. Anyone who tells you otherwise can’t be trusted to hold the highest office in this land.
The fight for civil rights is what drove me to get involved in politics in the first place. It's why I fought for and helped secure a 25-year extension of the Voting Rights Act. And it's why as president, I'll immediately sign the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act into law. https://t.co/fHqUvYahRR
55 years ago today, the Voting Rights Act was signed into law — bringing us one step closer to that more perfect union. As we mark its anniversary, we’ve got to continue our fight to restore the VRA and protect the sacred right to vote.
The scenes of death and destruction from Hiroshima and Nagasaki still horrify us 75 years later. They reach through history to remind us of the hideous damage nuclear weapons can inflict—and our collective responsibility to ensure they're never again used. https://t.co/357jRzBPeL
If I'm elected president, our students and educators will have all the tools and resources they need to succeed and get through COVID-19. https://t.co/ul9vTTcT40
Donald Trump promised to bring back jobs, but his policies crushed the manufacturing sector—and that was true even before COVID-19.

I’ll revitalize American manufacturing and innovation and create millions of good-paying jobs so we can build back better. https://t.co/HrOOkWWQof
Growing up in Scranton, I learned the importance of hard work, treating others with dignity and respect, and leaving no one behind. Those values have guided my entire life — and they're the values I'll bring back to the White House. https://t.co/aelfrxaISg
Folks, a lot of you have been asking when I’m announcing my running mate, and I promise I’ll let you know soon. But here’s what I can tell you right now: I’m going to tell my supporters first — so text FIRST to 30330 to be the first to know.
I don’t buy for one second that the vitality of American manufacturing is a thing of the past. As president, I'll make bold investments in American manufacturing, industry, and innovation to make sure the future is made in America — by all of America. https://t.co/LkIi8g6M5i
There's been a lot of talk about my vetting process lately. Here’s an inside look: https://t.co/tFRKJOE3hi
Weapons of war have no place in our communities. When I was a senator, I took on the @NRA and secured a 10-year ban on assault weapons — and as president, I’ll ban these weapons again. https://t.co/ggqSaj40EJ
Eight years ago, a white supremacist targeted a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, WI — ultimately taking seven lives in an unspeakable act of terror. To truly honor those we lost, it's up to all of us to stand up to bigotry in our lives, give hate no safe harbor, and reduce gun violence.
I truly believe that we can revitalize American manufacturing and create a better economy at the same time. I want to build an economy that brings everyone along — one that works for the middle class, not just the wealthy and well-connected. https://t.co/3fYbFfsvDb
The truth of the matter is, Donald Trump inherited a growing economy from President Obama and me. And just like everything else he inherited in his life, he squandered it. https://t.co/EPxDx4ecoU
From day one, Donald Trump downplayed the threat COVID-19 posed, ignored scientists, and refused to take action. 

Now, nearly 5 million cases and more than 150,000 deaths later, it's crystal clear we're paying the price for his failed leadership.
On day one, I’ll send a bill to Congress creating a clear roadmap to citizenship for Dreamers and the 11 million undocumented people already strengthening our nation. It’s long overdue. https://t.co/ajO7uUb9po
Thousands of Americans are dying every week. The President's response?

The Latino community is bearing disproportionate harm from this pandemic. But even before, many Latino families were already struggling. We've got to do better. That's why today, I'm releasing my new agenda for the Latino community: https://t.co/xgGUoleGQO
As president, I’ll take on the powerful gun lobby to pass universal background checks, ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and close loopholes to keep guns out of dangerous hands. We can and will end our gun violence epidemic.
One year ago, just hours after the massacre in El Paso, nine precious lives were cut short in Dayton. In the wake of the tragedies, Donald Trump promised the most modest of gun safety policies, then caved to the @NRA and failed to deliver.
On July 1st, Donald Trump predicted the coronavirus was going to just disappear.

He was wrong — and more than 25,000 Americans died due to the virus last month.

Mr. President, step up and do your job before even more American families feel the pain of losing a loved one.
When we spend taxpayer money, we should use it to buy American products and support American jobs. Period.

We’re going to make sure the future is made in America — by all of America: https://t.co/uTI6GyuTpX
Not a joke, folks.

Get yours today: https://t.co/RqCQJE8Kho https://t.co/A1CNMOu2ct
Every American should be able to safely make their voice heard this November. We need to:

- Expand vote-by-mail and early voting
- Implement online voter registration
- Make it safe and easy to vote in-person
Jill and I mourn the loss of the nine service members who perished in a training accident off the coast of California. These brave young men made the ultimate sacrifice in service to their fellow Americans. Our deepest condolences go out to their families.

In the days that followed the El Paso shooting, I said Americans have to come together, stand against hate, and leave nobody behind.

That charge feels more important than ever. This is our fight — and together, we will win. https://t.co/eX2xD0jhjX
It's hard to believe this has to be said, but if I'm elected president, I’ll spend my Monday mornings working with our nation’s top experts to control this virus — not insulting them on Twitter. https://t.co/o7p3e0kgRJ
This is a moment to summon the purpose we felt one year ago after El Paso. A moment to recommit to the battle for the soul of this nation. A battle against white supremacy, hatred, and gun violence.

It won't be easy — but it's a battle we must win.
One year ago, a white supremacist armed with a semi-automatic rifle targeted the people of El Paso. He thought his hatred of Latinos and immigrants would prove more powerful than the culture and vibrancy of the community.

He was wrong. https://t.co/d7ISze6dK7

It’s not enough to just go back to the way things were before these crises — we need to build back better than ever. We have to create a new American economy where everyone gets a fair return for their work and an equal chance to get ahead.
Now more than ever, we need a president who believes in science.
This pandemic has put a bright light on the disparities that have plagued our nation for too long. We’ve got to make sure these communities get the help they need now — and root out the systemic racism that created these inequalities in the first place. https://t.co/KZZx2T9ojT
Enhanced unemployment benefits expired for millions overnight.

We don’t have an effective nationwide testing program or a plan to control the virus.

Our health care workers still don’t have enough PPE.

Enough with the weekend golf trips, Mr. President. Do your job.
Rent is due today.

Donald Trump abdicated his responsibility to lead us out of this COVID-19 crisis—and we now face a potential housing crisis because of it.

Mr. President: Act now to make sure Americans don't have to choose between a roof over their heads or food on the table. https://t.co/b0Uoy5qoFr
You have enough on your plate — you shouldn't also have to worry about the president making things even tougher for you. https://t.co/HjwhG8kQMT
If we give Donald Trump four more years in the White House, he will forever alter the character of this nation.

We can’t let that happen.
To the millions of people who get up every single day and make this country run: I see you, and I promise I will never stop fighting for you. You are the backbone of America. https://t.co/009KRZx9Bq
Ordinary people doing extraordinary things. That's the story of America — and it's being written every day by folks like Dr. @Craig_A_Spencer, who fought the Ebola outbreak and now COVID-19. @BarackObama and I called to thank him for his service and discuss the moment we're in. https://t.co/wO14pwaaxa
Folks, we’re just a few hours away from our critical end-of-month fundraising deadline. We need everyone to step up so we can hit our goal and make sure we can go toe-to-toe with President Trump.

We’re facing some of the biggest challenges in our history — and it’s abundantly clear Donald Trump just isn’t up for the job.

We need real leadership — and we need it now.
It’s been over six months since the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the United States, and President Trump still doesn't have an effective plan to contain its spread. It's an unjustifiable failure of leadership that costs lives every day.
.@DrBiden and I wish all our Muslim friends and neighbors a blessed #EidAlAdha. May your sacrifices on this day be accepted and strengthen you during these challenging times. Eid Mubarak!
Human trafficking is an unconscionable attack on the dignity of the most vulnerable among us. Action can’t wait — on this World Day Against Trafficking in Persons, we’ve got to join together and commit to ending trafficking. #EndHumanTrafficking https://t.co/5UJHwaMRQI
You won't have to worry about my tweets when I'm president.
Bill Barr is the Attorney General of the United States — not the president's private attorney. https://t.co/XVfyErCZu9
55 years ago today, Medicare and Medicaid were signed into law. And ever since, they've extended lives, enhanced liberty, and put the pursuit of happiness within reach for millions.

I'll protect and expand these programs for generations to come. https://t.co/haLz46TAOD
Throughout his life, John Lewis taught us that while the journey toward equality is not easy, we must be unafraid and never cower and never, ever give up.

It's up to all of us to carry on his mission. https://t.co/VUJdegsBuw
It’s time Senate Republicans back their effusive praise of John Lewis with action. Pass the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act.
Even after his passing, John Lewis reminds us that the most powerful symbol of what it means to be an American is what we do with the time we have to make real the promise of our nation.

May his words guide us as we march on toward November. https://t.co/wmxgIqDDAi
The last three months were the worst period for economic growth our nation has experienced in the 70 years since we started measuring it — a drop of nearly 33 percent.

Let's be clear: This is no act of God, it's a failure of presidential leadership. https://t.co/pPZXkHtJcR
I'm the proud husband of a teacher. I've seen firsthand how difficult the job can be in normal times — let alone in the middle of a pandemic. So when I heard Beth's story, I knew @BarackObama and I had to give her a call. https://t.co/xBdeItoMW6
Donald Trump's instinct to constantly add fuel to the fire is the last thing our country needs right now.

We need leadership that will calm the waters and lower the temperature. https://t.co/tNUQUYDO8P
We need a president who will bring us together instead of tearing us apart and who will enforce the law faithfully rather than put his own political interests first. https://t.co/SL7dojwyDi
Folks, I'm excited to share that Senator @ewarren and I are hosting a grassroots fundraiser this Friday — and you're invited. We're going to chat about what's at stake this November and even answer a few of your questions.

Chip in any amount to join us: https://t.co/Ak0FXcwfoV https://t.co/j6OGUieI46
Donald Trump has shown that he can’t beat the pandemic or turn the economy around. And he is unsurprisingly stoking the flames of division for political gain.

He is the worst possible person to lead our nation through this moment. https://t.co/CfJzEwU6Cm
My heart goes out to Jessica and the countless others across the nation who have lost a loved one due to COVID-19. Behind every number we see in the news is a family and community that will never again be whole — and we can't forget that. https://t.co/S2NrhkXrHI
Congratulations to California Child Care Providers United on a successful election. As president, I'll make it easier for child care workers to unionize — and I’ll provide resources so they earn higher wages while also making care more affordable. #ChildCareIsEssential https://t.co/49zAdq9Mte
We need an effective, coordinated nationwide testing and tracing program. We need more PPE for health care workers. We need a comprehensive plan to get this virus under control.

We need this president to do his job.
I have no illusions about how tough the road ahead is. But I’m optimistic for one reason above all others: I know the history and the heart of this country.

There is nothing we're unable to achieve when we do it together.
Listen to the scientists: Wear a mask. https://t.co/9CFioW4wvS
Donald Trump voted by mail. You should be able to as well.
Small business ownership is one of our country's cornerstones for wealth building and job creation. But Black and Brown entrepreneurs face far too many barriers to ownership, growth, and success.

I've got a plan to change that: https://t.co/27Y38un2tM https://t.co/MF7OpMS7bA
America has never lived up to our founding promise — and we can’t rest until we finally do. My new plan will advance racial equity across the American economy and bring us closer to reaching our highest ideals: https://t.co/27Y38u5rCe https://t.co/pQGZ78PXwC
My housing plan will give a $15,000 tax credit to first-time home-buyers, expand affordable housing, and reverse President Trump’s efforts to gut fair housing enforcement.

We're going to remove the barriers to homeownership that hold back too many Americans of color.
To support more Black and Brown small businesses, my administration will launch a new Small Business Opportunity Initiative. We're going to make sure that those with the best ideas are not denied the venture capital or financing they need because of their race or zip code.
In good times, communities of color still lag. In bad times, they get hit first and the hardest. And in recovery, they take the longest to bounce back.

We have to break the cycle, and I’ve got a plan to do it: https://t.co/27Y38un2tM
This election is not just about voting against Donald Trump. It’s about rising to this moment of crisis, understanding people’s struggle, and building a future worthy of their courage and ambition to overcome.
A change of “tone” over a few days does not change the facts of the last four years.

Donald Trump fails the basic threshold test of being president: the duty to care about the entire country, not just his re-election prospects.
The Senate and this President should pass the bill to restore the Voting Rights Act — renamed yesterday in memory of John Lewis.

If they don’t, it will be one of the first things I do as president.
I'm in Wilmington, Delaware, to unveil the fourth plank of my Build Back Better plan. Tune in as I discuss what my administration will do to advance racial equity in our economy: https://t.co/NTZviQqUX5

Here's how we'll do it: https://t.co/27Y38un2tM https://t.co/d0kM3yyglS
We can't build this nation back better without tackling the systemic racism and disparities that have plagued our country for far too long. That's why today, I'm releasing my new plan to advance racial economic equity across the American economy. https://t.co/MQW8ItM0J8

As Hurricane Hanna makes landfall, Jill and I are sending our prayers to the people of South Texas. We must ensure that affected residents get the support they need — and get it quickly. If you are in an impacted region, please heed the advice of local officials and seek shelter.
I know firsthand how hard it can be to take care of an aging family member. It's why as president, I'll ease the financial burden on families and expand access to dignified care for older Americans. https://t.co/Z8FOorRgLe
No one should have to work more than one job to make ends meet. We have to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and build an inclusive middle class that brings everyone along.
There is no quit in America — and you deserve a president who won’t quit on you.
President Trump ordered his administration to slow down coronavirus testing, he tried to block CDC funding, and he has ignored the experts from day one. His actions defy both logic and humanity.
 
What kind of president actively undercuts efforts that will save lives?
Every American family deserves access to affordable, high-quality child care.

Here's how I'll make that happen: https://t.co/Z8FOorRgLe https://t.co/4woudaAGqo
I know times are tough, but I want you to know you're not alone. We're all in this fight together. And together, we'll emerge stronger than before.
The President has a duty to care for us all. To see people where they are and to understand what they’re going through.

I’ve been a single parent. Even though I had a lot more support than a lot of folks going through tough times, I know how hard it is. https://t.co/7JlGjvUcqd
This is the United States of America. We don’t settle — we aspire.

Let’s get to work.
The hard truth is that we can't just build back to the way things were before these crises — we have to build back better.

President @BarackObama and I discussed how we can do that, and much more: https://t.co/DBqIS5IoN3
Our nation is at a crossroads. We can choose four more years of Donald Trump’s divisive politics and failed leadership — or we can forge a new path forward. https://t.co/CHbtVP8IaV
Home care workers and child care workers — who are more often women, women of color, and immigrants — have been underpaid, unseen, and undervalued for far too long.

That will change with my administration: https://t.co/RbUFxJ3CYS
Donald Trump’s own staff admits that he fails the most important test of being the American President: the duty to care — for you, for all of us. https://t.co/mJf0xhEYZ5

Today, the House passed the #NoBanAct because no one should be discriminated against or singled out based on the faith they practice. I will end President Trump's Muslim Ban on day one and sign this bill into law.

Home health workers do God’s work, but aren’t paid much. They have few benefits, and 40% are still on SNAP or Medicaid. It's unacceptable.

I'll give caregivers and early childhood educators a much-needed raise.
We need to make high-quality child care affordable and accessible. As president, I'll give every 3- and 4-year-old access to free, high-quality preschool. And low- to middle-income families won’t spend more than 7% of their income on quality care for children under age 5.
Donald Trump simply doesn’t understand: We can’t deal with our economic crisis without solving the public health crisis.
 
And for all his bluster about his expertise on the economy, he is unable to explain how he will actually help the working families hit the hardest.
We have to mobilize a 21st century care and early childhood education workforce to deal with the caregiving crisis in our nation. Today, I'm delivering remarks about how we're going to get it done. Tune in: https://t.co/KyRgLogUaw

We have to vote Donald Trump out this November.
Imagine the future we can create with Donald Trump out of the White House. A future where we:

- Tackle the climate crisis
- Build a new American economy
- End our gun violence epidemic
- Ensure our government works for all, not just the wealthy few
In this moment of crisis, we have the chance to build a new American economy. One where everyone gets a fair return for their work and an equal chance to get ahead.

Together, we'll get it done.

Banning the Confederate flag from military installations was long overdue.

Eleven. That's how many times we've broken the single-day record for new COVID-19 cases in the last month.

This virus isn't going to just disappear like President Trump wants. It's surging — and we need real leadership from this White House to slow its spread.
I’ve released 21 years of my tax returns — why hasn’t Donald Trump?

We deserve to know what this president is hiding.
We have to make the places we live, work, and learn healthier and more energy-efficient. That's why my administration will upgrade 4 million buildings and weatherize 2 million homes across the country — creating over one million jobs in the process. https://t.co/JpXThuFg2d

President Obama and I left a playbook for President Trump on how to fight pandemics. He flat-out ignored it. And we're all paying the price every day.

President Trump needs to do everything in his power to surge nationwide testing — including developing and evaluating more accurate, affordable, accessible, faster tests so we can reopen safely.

Infection rates are rising at an alarming pace. Mr. President, act now.
Mr. President, “Open everything now,” isn’t a strategy for success. It’s barely a slogan. 

It’s long past time for you to step up and do your job.
This pandemic has gotten bad enough that even Donald Trump finally decided to wear a mask in public.

I’m glad he made that shift — but it’s not enough.

Good-paying, union jobs that put Americans to work. https://t.co/AKl9jZKB0s
Every few weeks when he needs a distraction from the latest charge of corruption in his staff — or the conviction of high ranking members of his administration — Donald Trump announces it’s “Infrastructure Week.”

We can’t just build things back to the way they were — we’ve got to build America back better. Tune in as I deliver remarks on how we're going to invest in infrastructure and clean energy and create millions of jobs in the process: https://t.co/c3kocZapIH
I want every single American to know: If you're sick, struggling, or worried about how you're going to get through the day, I will not abandon you.

We're all in this together. And together, we'll emerge stronger than before. https://t.co/NUg03vokKp
We shouldn't have to beg this president to listen to the experts.
The hard truth is it didn't have to be this bad. But Donald Trump has squandered every chance he's had to contain the spread of this virus. https://t.co/lV8cjQbAO9
America can’t sit on the sidelines in the race for the future. My administration will invest $300 billion in research and development over four years to secure our global leadership and create millions of good-paying jobs. https://t.co/xx2oLJ8VEt
We're leading the world. https://t.co/QQzaQeKAUj
Donald Trump needs to spend less time playing golf and more time listening to experts like Dr. Fauci.
In January, I sounded the alarm regarding COVID-19. 

Over five months later, President Trump still hasn't taken the action needed to respond to the virus. It's unacceptable.

This president has failed the American people every step of the way. https://t.co/PH4vF5KLuI
The stakes couldn't be higher this November. Time and time again, Donald Trump has failed the people of Puerto Rico.

As President, I'll spur economic development on the island and expand access to health care.
Together, we're going to build a new American economy: https://t.co/RvfzbDN7dP https://t.co/5TePAe7tbY
It's hard to believe this has to be said, but unlike this president, I'll actually listen to the experts and heed their advice. Not silence them. https://t.co/AkLFevCI6b
Mohamed Amashah is finally home after 486 days in Egyptian prison for holding a protest sign. Arresting, torturing, and exiling activists like Sarah Hegazy and Mohamed Soltan or threatening their families is unacceptable. No more blank checks for Trump’s favorite dictator. https://t.co/RtZkbGh6ik
Ignore the polls.

We’ve got work to do: https://t.co/GCxsKwFY4h https://t.co/fnJezEaAg5
Health care is personal to me. And as president, I'll do everything I can to make sure every American has access to the care they need. https://t.co/Rmwsmx54KW
We need a president who will always choose to unite rather than divide, because there’s nothing we can’t accomplish when we do it together.
To all the nurses on the frontlines of this fight, thank you. You are American heroes. https://t.co/fgTDhXU72C
Donald Trump is the worst possible person to lead us through this moment.

We need real leadership, right now. Lives are at stake. https://t.co/7mJYPGLGq7
Back in January, when President Trump signed his hollow phase one trade deal with Beijing, I made clear that no one should be fooled by Trump's empty promises to deliver a meaningful “phase two deal.

Good to see that he's finally admitting I was right. https://t.co/Us8t3Z0KfA
I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in modern American history. Every day that he remains in office, he further threatens the future of our democracy.

We have to vote him out this November. https://t.co/FuoAnNzgHG
I have no illusion about how tough the road ahead is. But I’m optimistic for one reason above all others: I know the history and the heart of this country.

Given a chance, ordinary Americans can do extraordinary things. https://t.co/448jA7xlY3
This was almost two months ago. 

Since then? Tens of thousands more lives lost. A million and a half new cases.

The President? Still golfing. https://t.co/rHvIX80tLA
The United States has over 3 million cases of COVID-19, and over 130,000 people have died — yet Donald Trump continues to say it will just fade away. It’s unbelievable.

We're paying the price for this president's incompetence every single day.
I see a different America than President Trump. One that, despite all our flaws and shortcomings and failings, is still after more than two centuries dedicated to equality, liberty, human dignity, and justice.

I know we can reach our highest ideals — together.
Still true. https://t.co/3zbAD3uXzq
Determination. Resilience. Grit. The strength to get up no matter how many times you’ve been knocked down. Respect for hard work, and for the people who do it.
 
Those are the values I learned growing up in Scranton — and they're the values I’ll take to the Oval Office.
This is what “America First” looks like under President Trump: https://t.co/jSmJOeG13G
Through every trial and tribulation, we've always emerged stronger — and we will again.
Let’s use this opportunity to make bold investments in American industry and innovation so the future is made in America — and in all of America.

https://t.co/uTI6Gydi1n https://t.co/8F8Uj2a3BI
Here's my promise to you: If I have the honor of being elected president, I will take care of your family like I would my own. https://t.co/vYmVUdMLO7
The American people deserve to know what Donald Trump is hiding in his tax returns.
We can't just build back to the way things were before these crises — we have to build back better.
This is our moment to imagine and build a new American economy — one where everyone gets a fair return for their work and an equal chance to get ahead. https://t.co/BPUISe4Fd6
I do not buy for one second that the vitality of American manufacturing is a thing of the past.
 
American manufacturing was the Arsenal of Democracy in World War II, and must be part of the engine of American prosperity now.
We can't just focus on the jobs of today — we have to also focus on the jobs and industries of tomorrow. I'll make a historic $300 billion investment in research and development that will spur innovation and help create 3 million jobs across the nation. https://t.co/o29BPuYSlb
American workers can out-compete anyone, but they need a government that fights for them. I'll revitalize American manufacturing — especially smaller manufacturers and those owned by women and people of color — and ensure the future is made here in America. https://t.co/lJQBsnRN75
When we spend taxpayer money, we should use it to buy American products &amp; support American jobs.

But under Trump, the rate of federal contractors offshoring jobs more than doubled. It's unacceptable.

I'll invest $400 billion in American-made products &amp; keep jobs here at home. https://t.co/iNpPuMzFqC
I'm in Dunmore, Pennsylvania, to discuss my plan to create jobs, raise wages, and help America build back better. Tune in to watch: https://t.co/fSHMWax1u6
We're in the middle of an economic crisis. But it's not enough to just turn things around — we have to build back better. We have to revitalize American manufacturing and make sure the future is made in America — by all of America.

Here's how we'll do it: https://t.co/lPgZPDPC98 https://t.co/ZjJ3pKiLrK
The future must be made in America — by all of America. Here's how we'll do it: https://t.co/lPgZPE7d0G https://t.co/KERhYFcXAY
As I was saying. https://t.co/NwOKjL0Zhj
Four years of Betsy DeVos is more than enough. We need a Secretary of Education who is actually a public school educator.
I commend the Task Forces for their service and for helping build a bold, transformative platform for our party and for our country. And I am deeply grateful to @BernieSanders for working with us to unite our party and deliver real, lasting change for generations to come. https://t.co/J2LN6cKBhT
Increased testing isn’t the reason for the surge in coronavirus cases — Donald Trump's failed leadership is. https://t.co/j7vKxnlaj4
Trump launched his 2016 campaign by calling Mexicans rapists.

He's spread racism against our Latino community ever since.

We need to work in partnership with Mexico.

We need to restore dignity and humanity to our immigration system.

That's what I'll do as President.
Let me be clear: No one should be forced out of their home in the middle of a pandemic because they can’t pay rent. https://t.co/0NJ9ao7HON
When there were 15 cases, the President said it wouldn't spread any farther. 

We just hit our 3 millionth case.

We're paying for his failure. https://t.co/gYwTWZyYOs
.@AdyBarkan — The courage you show every day is an inspiration to so many, and I'm grateful to have you by my side in this fight. We may not agree on everything, but this we do: Health care is a right — not a privilege. And we're going to make that a reality, together. https://t.co/5fVic34K89
This is a national disgrace. We have to ensure these communities get the care they need immediately — and then tackle racial disparities in health care and our economy head-on. https://t.co/e4QbS4p0wZ
The most sacred obligation of our government is to keep our troops safe when we send them into battle — and to care for them when they come home. We need a president who will honor that obligation. https://t.co/UMrDVwHaD3
Across the world, people come to this country with unrelenting optimism and determination toward the future. They study here, innovate here, they make America who we are. Donald Trump doesn't get that — we need a president who does. https://t.co/0VK0MCXMVq
Americans are safer when America is engaged in strengthening global health. On my first day as President, I will rejoin the @WHO and restore our leadership on the world stage. https://t.co/8uazVIgPZB
We've seen what happens when the federal government fails to secure sufficient supplies of critical products like PPE — and we can't let it happen again. So today, I'm releasing my plan to rebuild U.S. supply chains: https://t.co/5RXYqQcqmn
Donald Trump needs to do his job.
Character belongs in the White House. https://t.co/Bz1syMprhJ
To beat COVID-19, we need a coordinated national response from the federal government — but Donald Trump refuses to do his job. I've laid out exactly what I would do, and I encourage this president to adopt the plan in its entirety: https://t.co/SOVOPL7uPy
There’s enormous opportunity once we defeat Donald Trump. We are going to build our health care system, our economy, and our country back better than they've ever been before.
The nation is crying out for leadership — leadership that can unite us and bring us together. But this president has nothing to offer. https://t.co/rzV0GdOqHN
With COVID-19 surging across the nation, Donald Trump should be doing everything in his power to increase access to testing. Instead, he's doing the opposite. It's despicable.
It didn't have to be this bad. But Donald Trump failed to do his job — and we're all paying the price. https://t.co/OXONhAWNqy
We can’t afford four more years of Donald Trump. https://t.co/12yF31aLSz
We're going to beat Donald Trump. And when we do, we won't just rebuild this nation — we'll transform it.
There are so many unsung heroes in our communities, especially in times of crisis. We owe Alassane and countless others a debt of gratitude — and I'll fight for them every day in the White House. https://t.co/tUwZYpeoNW
On this Venezuelan Independence Day, my thoughts are with Venezuelans who continue to work tirelessly for the cause of democracy. It’s time for free and fair elections so that the Venezuelan people can turn the page on the corrupt and repressive Maduro regime.
COVID-19 is surging across the nation, and this president is doubling down on his efforts to rip health insurance and protections away from millions. It's heartless and cruel and must be stopped.
Donald Trump wants to declare this health crisis over and unemployment solved so that he can get back to his campaign rallies. But he’s wrong — on both fronts.

We need a president who will actually do the work needed to get us through these crises.
The hard truth is that it didn’t have to be this bad, but Donald Trump ignored the warnings and refused to take action. He failed our nation. https://t.co/AcY62E8L2L
I’ve carried the middle class values that my parents instilled in me my entire life — and they’re the values I’ll bring to the White House. https://t.co/WPIzFPD9Mv
Make no mistake, our best days still lie ahead. If we come together as one America, there’s not a single thing we cannot do.
The health care workers on the frontlines of this fight are some of the greatest heroes our nation has ever seen. https://t.co/Ry6TvJcbuU
America was founded on the promise of equality, liberty, and justice for all — and it's long past time we lived up to it.
American history isn’t a fairytale. The battle for the soul of this nation has been a constant push-and-pull for more than 240 years. But it’s a battle we can and will win — together.
This Fourth of July, one of the most patriotic things you can do is wear a mask.
Our nation was founded on a simple idea: We're all created equal. We've never lived up to it — but we've never stopped trying. This Independence Day, let's not just celebrate those words, let's commit to finally fulfill them. Happy #FourthOfJuly! https://t.co/1WrATlx8Xl
“If you put the wrong person in office, you'll see things that you would not have believed are possible. https://t.co/8gDSbOJbeS
It didn't have to be this bad. But month after month, as other leaders in other countries took the necessary steps to get the virus under control, Donald Trump failed us.

Here's what I'll do as president: https://t.co/xsCrfzWnxC
It’s abundantly clear that this virus isn’t going to just “fade away,” Mr. President. It’s time for you to step up, take action, and lead. https://t.co/8UlIAKzv1q
Now more than ever, we need a president who will choose science over fiction.
Donald Trump styled himself as a wartime president. But now it seems this president has surrendered. He has waved the white flag and left the field of battle when we need him most. It's unacceptable.

We need real leadership. Right now. https://t.co/2T3WbFLYV3
Donald Trump has called himself a cheerleader for the nation. But we don't need a cheerleader — we need a President. One who will:

- Lead by example
- Take responsibility
- Tell the unvarnished truth
- Listen to the experts and follow the science
Wear a mask. https://t.co/HBDMNA4ary
Let me be clear: There’s no victory to be celebrated when we’re still down nearly 15 million jobs and the pandemic is getting worse, not better. https://t.co/60inyb1vT9
This is a job Donald Trump is entirely unfit for. https://t.co/7vipLgLCiU
“Mr. President, it's too much.” https://t.co/WEebjiPKgj
This is a shameful move. Now is the time for employers to have empathy for families juggling work and caregiving.

It's long past time for President Trump to show some leadership so we can get this virus under control. https://t.co/Z2DsWMCcLf
Tune in as I address the nation on the economic crisis and the latest jobs report: https://t.co/SKrDmWptL4
Mr. President, this pandemic isn't about you. It's about the health and well-being of the American people. https://t.co/uxRijdtTmj
125 days. https://t.co/8XWNjhwJzL
I’ll read my daily briefings.
Small businesses are the backbone of communities across our nation, and we need to do so much more to help them. Donald Trump may have forgotten about them — but I never will. https://t.co/RDYKzt1Qc1
We need a clear message from the very top of our federal government that everyone needs to wear a mask in public. Period.

It’s not just about you — it’s about your family, your neighbors, your colleagues. It’s about keeping other people safe.
This is my promise to you: When I am President, I will take care of your health care coverage and your family the same way I would my own. https://t.co/Ahq3vZHT5l
As #ImmigrantHeritageMonth comes to a close, I want to make one thing clear: Immigrants have always made our nation stronger — our diversity is, and has always been, our greatest strength.

Donald Trump doesn't get that — we need a president who does.
Folks, we’re just a few hours away from our end-of-quarter deadline, and we need your help to hit our goal. Every donation — big or small — goes a long way to helping us catch up to Donald Trump.

If you can, please chip in today: https://t.co/18tN9TNYtX
On the final day of #PrideMonth, here’s my promise to you: If I have the honor of being elected, I will be the most pro-equality president in our nation’s history. LGBTQ+ rights are human rights — and we can't rest until everyone is treated with dignity and respect under the law.
We’re facing a serious threat — and we need to meet it together as one country. But this President gives us no direction and actively pits us against one another.

We can't continue on like this. https://t.co/LA8OJ86Nnk
If I’m elected, I’ll immediately reach out to Dr. Fauci and ask him to continue his incredible service to our country. 

I’ll have the nation’s top medical experts and scientists ready to advise our response on day one — and I'll actually listen to them.
Mr. President, the American people didn’t make enormous sacrifices over the past four months so you could waste your time with late night rants and tweets.

Step up. Take responsibility. Do your job.
Tune in as I deliver remarks on how President Trump failed to protect the American people, save our economy, and control the virus: https://t.co/pqbJECpUHQ
I want every single American to know: if you’re sick, if you’re struggling, if you’re worried about how you’re going to get through the day — I will not abandon you. I will not leave you to face these challenges alone.

We are going to get through this — together.
As simple as it sounds, we need a president who listens. So much of this could have been prevented if Donald Trump listened to someone other than himself.
Folks, tomorrow night marks our first end-of-quarter deadline of the general election. We need your help to hit our goal so we can catch up to Donald Trump's hefty cash-on-hand advantage.
 
I know times are tough, but if you're able, please chip in today: https://t.co/mv8ZZdhwAI
The President spent his weekend golfing. https://t.co/zQepsL9lUp
Here’s my promise to you: I’ll appoint a director who will actually go after financial predators and protect consumers. https://t.co/LYY54KXbUk
Today's decision reaffirmed that states can't put in place laws that unduly burden a woman's right to make her own health care decisions—but the fight isn't over. As President, I'll codify Roe v. Wade and protect a woman’s constitutional right to choose. 
https://t.co/qFrH8hFst8
It's time we remember who we are as Americans: we treat each other with dignity and respect, we leave nobody behind, and we give hate no safe harbor.

We are everything that Donald Trump is not.
William Perry Pendley spent his career fighting to sell off public lands — and to allow drilling, mining, and logging on them with hardly any oversight. 

Now the President has nominated him to oversee them at @BLMNational. Consider me opposed. https://t.co/jwlQGs68kO
White supremacy should be rooted out and relegated to the pages of history — not promoted by the President of the United States.
The arc of the moral universe bent a little bit more today. https://t.co/OzyeyLc3Rc
Obamacare was and is a big deal. We can't let Donald Trump tear it down — we have to protect and build on it. https://t.co/P9QZvidZmD
51 years ago today, a movement was born on Christopher Street. As we remember the anniversary of the Stonewall Uprising and the brave individuals who changed our world forever, let's recommit to finishing the job and finally achieving full LGBTQ+ equality. #Pride https://t.co/PzbGOMy0zx
Donald Trump's entire presidency has been a gift to Putin, but this is beyond the pale. It’s a betrayal of the most sacred duty we bear as a nation, to protect and equip our troops when we send them into harm’s way. https://t.co/r6DCWowxc4
Today the President shared a video of people shouting “white power” and said they were “great.” Just like he did after Charlottesville. 

We’re in a battle for the soul of the nation — and the President has picked a side. But make no mistake: it’s a battle we will win.
Children should be released from ICE detention with their parents immediately. This is pretty simple, and I can't believe I have to say it: Families belong together. https://t.co/11F5X71AO1
Now, let's push our progress further.

https://t.co/gm6jgUrcaT https://t.co/06VQXBIkTu
Every day that Donald Trump sits in the Oval Office, he proves just how unfit he is to lead our nation.
Wear a mask. https://t.co/lejMbH1jjC
If Donald Trump prevails in the U.S. Supreme Court, insurers could strip away your health insurance coverage or jack up premiums — simply because you experience long-term effects after battling the coronavirus.

We can't let that happen. https://t.co/cpgHP1FQuS
Equal representation and participation matter. #DCStatehood https://t.co/EmwKbEeuI3
I know these times are dark, but I firmly believe that our best days still lie ahead. If we come together as one America, there's nothing that we can't accomplish.
Health care is a right for all — not a privilege for the few. We have to ensure every single American has access to the care they need and deserve.

Here’s what I would do as president: https://t.co/gm6jgUrcaT https://t.co/4zuTzH6zt9
Congratulations, Alexis. We need you in this fight. Proud to stand with you and Planned Parenthood Action Fund. https://t.co/7x7UP9KutR

Donald Trump is acting like a child who just can’t believe this pandemic has happened to him. https://t.co/06xilwAmlV
Last week, President Trump claimed the virus would fade away.

Now, we're facing a record-high number of new cases, and it's surging across the country.

Trump refuses to listen to the experts and take action — and we're all paying the price.
In this moment, we have an enormous opportunity to root out systemic racism and close the racial wealth and income gaps. We can do it, together. https://t.co/l6AmXzfDDB
Donald Trump is the worst possible person to lead us through a global pandemic.
DC should be a state. Pass it on. https://t.co/xUJ1sud76f
The American people have sacrificed so much to fight this virus — we've lost lives, businesses, paychecks. And now, we're losing the progress we've made because this president refuses to do his job.

Donald Trump has failed our nation every step of the way. https://t.co/k5CCKcJzjZ
While President Trump continues his victory lap, over 20 million Americans remain out of work. He may have forgotten about you, but I never will — and I'll fight for you every single day in the White House. https://t.co/cuBH5ufI2f
While the Trump Administration continues their efforts to rip health care away from millions, I'm speaking about how we can make quality, affordable health care available to every American.  Tune in: https://t.co/CJ8KWt4Z2M
Health care workers are selflessly risking their lives every day on the front lines of the fight against COVID-19 — and hundreds have paid the ultimate price.

They are American heroes — and we cannot forget the sacrifices they made to care for us all. https://t.co/JBlSo0mYdb
Democracy is under threat globally. Restoring the soul of America means fixing democracy at home, and confronting — not cozying up to — dictators around the world. When I'm president, America will defend democracy at home and abroad. https://t.co/3L6gqvXgI7
Health care is a right for all — not a privilege for the few.
This virus is not just going to disappear because you want it to, Mr. President.

Workers called back on the job deserve access to regular, reliable COVID-19 testing.
Instead of passing police reform or helping hardworking Americans get through this crisis, Republicans are jamming through another one of Trump’s unqualified nominees. It's wrong.

Cory Wilson lacks judicial temperament and experience—and has no place on a Federal Court. https://t.co/jmVXBZroCa
We need a president who will expand access to quality, affordable health care — not rip it away.

Our planet cannot take four more years of Donald Trump. https://t.co/0Wrl9URSxF
The American people are tough, resilient, and always full of hope. There’s not a single thing we can't do if we do it together.
It's clear Donald Trump will stop at nothing to tear down Obamacare and rip health care away from millions. We cannot let him get away with it. We have to build on the ACA with a new public option to ensure everyone receives the care they deserve. https://t.co/34NCSYhO2C
It's pretty simple: If we want to save people's jobs and save people's lives, we need more testing — and we need it faster. The President is intentionally slowing it down. https://t.co/bu1oq1TwzL
This is yet another attempt to distract from this Administration's failure to lead an effective response to COVID-19. Immigrants help grow our economy and create jobs. The President can't scapegoat his way out of this crisis. https://t.co/FEqWNJG6TK
It's worth repeating that this weekend, President Trump admitted he directed his administration to slow down coronavirus testing in the middle of a global pandemic.

He continues to prove just how unfit he is to lead our nation.
To Ashley, and all the health care workers on the front lines of this fight, thank you. You are American heroes. https://t.co/B6UCR5xmhc

We can overcome four years of Donald Trump. But if we give him eight years in the White House, he will forever alter the character of our nation.

I can't believe I have to say this, but we should be speeding up testing — not slowing it down. https://t.co/zuZh7DiQ9X

Folks credit me for speaking out on marriage equality in 2012 — but I'm not the one who took a real risk. Countless others did the hard work and paid a price just for being themselves. Christian Cooper and I discussed the trailblazers who came before us and the work that remains: https://t.co/bEPmsRgZDo
Donald Trump is so eager to get back to his campaign rallies that he’s willing to put people at risk and violate CDC guidelines — as long as they sign a waiver promising not to hold his campaign liable.

Unbelievable.
The Tulsa Race Massacre is one of the worst incidents of racial violence in our history — and it has been erased from our national consciousness for far too long.

It’s time we reckon with what happened in 1921. https://t.co/wYX3Adq3vN
Christian Cooper’s encounter in Central Park was another wake-up call for our nation and a reminder of the work that remains to root out hate and intolerance. I'm grateful for Christian's support and know with folks like him leading the way, we'll get the job done. https://t.co/XWhcTjbo0t
We're months into this pandemic and still don't have proper testing, PPE, or clear nationwide guidance. Instead, Donald Trump:

- Pushes dangerous, disproven drugs
- Stands in the way of the CDC
- Refuses to wear a mask

He is failing even the most basic test of leadership.
I know it can be hard to keep faith that we will ever achieve that more perfect union we strive to be. But ours is a union worth fighting for — and we are all called to the cause.

None of us can turn away. None of us can stay silent.
Donald Trump’s failure to fight the coronavirus with the same energy and focus that he uses to troll his enemies on Twitter has cost us lives — and is putting hope for an economic recovery at risk.
I’ve said from the outset of this election that we are in a battle for the soul of this nation. Who we are. What we believe. And maybe most important — who we want to be. It’s all at stake.

That's the case we're making in our first TV ad of the general election: https://t.co/gGeSmBIIxA
On June 19, 1865, in Galveston, TX, the last enslaved African Americans were finally given notice of their freedom. 155 years later, we're still on the long road to equality, equity, and fairness for all.

We can't rest until the promise of this nation is fulfilled. #Juneteenth https://t.co/ZHOH8Hz57H
#Juneteenth reminds us of how vulnerable our nation is to being poisoned by systems and acts of inhumanity—but it's also a reminder of our ability to change. Together, we can lay the roots of real and lasting justice, and become the extraordinary nation that was promised to all.
Amy — from the moment you announced you were running for president in a snowstorm, it wasn't hard to see you had the grit and determination to do anything you set your mind to. You know how to get things done. With your help, we’re going to beat Donald Trump. https://t.co/4kquPZtSV9
To all the Dreamers who make our country better and stronger every single day: Thank you. This country needs you. #HomeIsHere https://t.co/VZPVqY1cgq
The decisions of the last few days should remind us all of the immense power of the Supreme Court — and the generational impact its justices can have.

We have the power to shape the Court's future this November — and we can’t forget that.
I'm ready on day one. After more than three years in office, why isn't Donald Trump ready? https://t.co/ksgxTsG7QK
Dreamers are Americans. Period.
Just like Donald Trump couldn’t wish COVID-19 away in March, and just like he couldn’t tweet it away in April — he can’t ignore it away in June. https://t.co/nOBnrL4rWi
Here’s my promise to you: On day one, I’ll send a bill to Congress that creates a clear roadmap to citizenship for Dreamers and 11 million undocumented people who are already strengthening our nation. It’s long overdue.
It didn’t have to be this bad. But we have a president who is more interested in taking a victory lap than he is in doing the work needed to solve this crisis.

We need a president who will put the American people first — and actually do the work. https://t.co/Lk1GDmSmAM
Thanks, Barack. You're right — and we won't stop until every Dreamer feels safe in this country. https://t.co/fVoZRhabRy
Donald Trump inherited a growing economy from President Obama and me. And just like everything else he has inherited in his life, he has squandered it. https://t.co/kxBBzhxvxc
Donald Trump wants to style himself a wartime president against an invisible enemy — but he has surrendered the fight.

Instead of leading the charge to defeat this virus, he has waved the white flag and retreated.
Vice President Pence claimed success because COVID-19 deaths are “down to” fewer than 750 a day.

That's more than 20,000 a month — and they're self-congratulating? Unbelievable.

It may be good enough for President Trump, but it will never be acceptable if I am President. https://t.co/9h08nxjC6k
I’m proud to stand with folks across the country participating in today’s #WorkersFirst Caravan. Senate Republicans need to pass the #HeroesAct now and take action to root out systemic racism. https://t.co/s5zCJBXYIp
If John Bolton's accounts are true, it’s not only morally repugnant, it’s a violation of Donald Trump’s sacred duty to the American people to protect America’s interests and defend our values.
Donald Trump ignored the experts, downplayed the threat COVID-19 posed, and failed to take the action necessary to contain it — and now in many states, COVID cases are on the rise again.

This president has failed to lead our nation. https://t.co/1fdu8WMeN5
Five years ago, nine good souls were ripped from this world — killed by hate and white supremacy. Today, we honor the memory of the Emanuel Nine and the unspeakable grace of those they left behind. https://t.co/zpVG2ak8aK
I'm in Darby, Pennsylvania, to discuss how we can make sure the country's reopening is safe, effective, and gets Americans back to work. Tune in: https://t.co/VaCPc32w9A
The truth of our nation is that too often the color of your skin alone can endanger your life and, for far too long, systemic racism has oppressed communities of color in the United States.

It has to change.
I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: Donald Trump is running the most corrupt administration in modern American history. https://t.co/6Uxn50HzH9
We have the power to write the future we want for this country. One where health care is a right, we lead the world in the fight against climate change, we end our gun violence epidemic, and our government works for all — not just the powerful.

Let’s do it together.
We can’t forget that in the middle of a global pandemic, the Trump Administration is trying to gut Obamacare and rip health insurance away from millions. It's morally reprehensible.
Systemic racism pervades every part of our society, including law enforcement — and we have to do the hard work to root it out. In January, I sat down with Jake, a field organizer on our campaign, to listen to what he had to say and discuss how we can move forward: https://t.co/mVkxpWxbod
This virus won’t just go away because you want it to, Mr. President. It’s time for you to step up and do your job.
Los Dreamers son estadounidenses. Trump les quitó la protección que lograron con tanto esfuerzo. Esto es inaceptable. El primer día de mi presidencia enviaré un proyecto de ley al Congreso que protegerá a los beneficiarios de DACA de la deportación. https://t.co/mGmTA03HEq
LGBTQ+ rights are human rights. Period.
Folks, I’ve got some big news: Next week, I’m getting together with my friend and former boss, President @BarackObama, for a virtual grassroots fundraiser. We would love to see you there.
 
Chip in now to get your ticket: https://t.co/UD3RHHKIw1
Dreamers are Americans. But Trump's ripped away the hard-won protections of DACA recipients, throwing their lives into upheaval. It’s unacceptable, and on day one of my presidency I will protect them from deportation and send a bill to Congress. https://t.co/YlvFuCaTrZ
I wish I could say this hate began with Donald Trump and will end with him. It didn’t, and it won’t. American history isn’t a fairytale with a guaranteed happy ending.
 
It's up to all of us to do the hard work to ensure the American ideal finally wins out. https://t.co/iUyi82zXN7
I'm grateful for @PPact's support and proud to stand with them in this fight. As president, I’m going to do everything in my power to expand access to quality, affordable health care — including reproductive health care. https://t.co/dYHAOGlfSQ
Donald Trump is not responsible for COVID-19, but he does bear full responsibility for his slow, uncoordinated, bungled response. https://t.co/IUdWpqZncn
Race-neutral policies are not a sufficient response to race-based disparities. We need to tackle systemic racism head-on and ensure everyone has a fair shot at the American dream.

Here’s what I would do as president: https://t.co/Ni1rAm8DNZ
Today's decision is another step in our march toward equality for all. The Supreme Court has confirmed the simple but profoundly American idea that every human being should be treated with respect. But we're not done. https://t.co/Bz4SMA9tgb
After reports of wealthy Trump donors getting millions in relief meant for small businesses, the administration is now refusing to disclose where the PPP money went. It's unacceptable.

The American people deserve answers. https://t.co/F2n3PA7RZU
In every corner of the country, people are raising their voices and demanding justice. It gives me so much hope.

Together, we’re going to transform this nation and ensure justice finally rings out for all.
We need a president who heals — not one who fans the flames of hate.
 
We need a president who unites — not one who sows further discord for political gain.
 
We need a president who leads the way with a steady hand — not one who incites violence with his erratic tweets.
We’re facing some of the greatest challenges in our nation’s history — and it’s clear Donald Trump isn’t up for the job.

We need real leadership, right now.
We have to ensure every worker called back on the job has access to regular, reliable COVID-19 testing and effective personal protective equipment. https://t.co/lDPQP3jZkw
We need a president who will fight to further LGBTQ+ equality — not roll back the hard-won progress we've already made.
We need real policing reform — and we need it now. https://t.co/HkBvD8QsmL
Our nation is at an inflection point. We can't go back to the way things were before — we have to take a bold step forward and usher in a new era of equality and opportunity.

We can do it, together.
Here's my promise to you: I will seek to heal the racial wounds that have long plagued our nation — not use them for political gain.

We shouldn’t accept anything less from an American president. https://t.co/I0r60NW4SU
We need a national ban on chokeholds. Now.
I’ve said from the outset of this election that we are in a battle for the soul of this nation. That is truer today than ever. If we give Donald Trump eight years in the White House, he will fundamentally alter the character of this nation.
 
We can’t let that happen.
In light of Donald Trump's inhumane reversal of protections for transgender people, I want to share a conversation I had a few weeks ago. Adi deserves to be treated with the same respect and dignity as anyone else. Period. https://t.co/nr1u0vOvog
On the fourth anniversary of Pulse.
In the middle of Pride month.
During a global pandemic.

Donald Trump's cruelty truly knows no bounds. We have to defeat him this November. https://t.co/YAy4ZGxxyD
Two years after Trump's Singapore meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, the U.S. and our allies are less safe and Kim's arsenal of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles keeps growing. Photo-ops and love letters are no substitute for deterrence and principled diplomacy. https://t.co/YfaCdlwJ8S
Medgar Evers once said, freedom has never been free. On this day in 1963, he paid the ultimate price in pursuit of freedom for his brothers and sisters. He was gunned down fighting to end racial injustice. We must honor him by carrying forward that cause in our own lives today.
Four years ago today, 49 lives were cut short in an act of unspeakable terrorism at Pulse nightclub. As we remember those we lost — including so many in the LGBTQ+ and Hispanic communities — we have to double down on our efforts to #HonorThemWithAction. https://t.co/TKaZ4M7IFF
We need real policing reform, and we need it now. Congress should immediately:

- Outlaw chokeholds
- Improve oversight and accountability
- Create a model use of force standard
- Stop the transfer of weapons of war to local police forces
Donald Trump forgot about COVID-19, but COVID-19 didn’t forget about us. 

The President couldn’t wish away the virus in April, he couldn’t tweet it away in May, and he can’t ignore it away in June.
Our country is crying out for leadership that Donald Trump can’t deliver. https://t.co/QHvUdgg6Io
We need a president who chooses hope over fear.
We can't let history repeat itself — Facebook needs to act now to stop the spread of disinformation and protect our elections. Watch my deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield break down what's happening and how you can help us fix it: https://t.co/WYMMAWkuLZ https://t.co/OGG2wwtW2P
COVID-19 can affect anyone, anywhere — but it doesn't impact every community equally. Watch as Dr. Ebony Jade Hilton explains how it’s impacting communities of color: https://t.co/3uuXEsfyv4
While the president was spiking the football and taking a victory lap, another 1.5 million Americans filed new unemployment claims last week.
 
He is completely oblivious to what's really happening in this country — and hardworking Americans are paying the price. https://t.co/AglBowCtKc
We have to ensure our economic reopening is safe and strong — and builds the foundation for an economy that works for everyone. Today, I'm releasing my plan to make that happen: https://t.co/v6hImc0J3q
We have to make sure our economic reopening is safe, effective, and gets Americans back to work. Tune in for a roundtable discussion on how we can make that happen: https://t.co/7WIbtob6WE

With less than 150 days until Election Day, the stakes couldn't be higher. We've got to fix Facebook to protect our democracy and ensure fair elections.
 
If you agree, sign the open letter today to demand Facebook take action. #MoveFastFixIt https://t.co/6Hmta4UxS9
So far, Facebook has failed to enact any real reforms to stop the spread of disinformation on its platform. Time is running out.
 
Today, we're releasing an open letter demanding the company change its policies: https://t.co/S1WIQTsfEL
Folks, we saw in 2016 what can happen when social media platforms are left unchecked and allow disinformation to run rampant. It puts the very integrity of our elections at risk.
 
We simply cannot let it happen again in 2020.
It's in our darkest moments that we've produced some of our greatest progress — and we have that opportunity once again. Let's make this a moment of action to address systemic racism and propel our nation into an era of true equality and opportunity.
There is systemic racism not just in our law enforcement but also in housing, education, and everything we do — and we have to do the hard work to end it. https://t.co/w9H77Jbuqa
We have to make this an era of action — starting with real police reform. No more excuses. No more delays.
 
Add your name to demand Congress ban chokeholds — and pass real police reform — right now: https://t.co/Sa6sPy2BtS
This pandemic isn't just going to go away because you want it to, Mr. President. Step up and do your job before your negligence costs even more lives than it already has. https://t.co/L6QfV31eFQ

Nothing about the fights we're facing will be easy. Racism has been a fixture in our society for hundreds of years. 
 
But I’m ready to get to work on day one. We can’t accept anything less from an American president.
Donald Trump’s hate-filled, conspiracy-laden rhetoric is inflaming the racial divides in our country—but just fixing the way the president talks won’t cut it. We need to root out systemic racism and ensure Black Americans have a real shot to get ahead. https://t.co/FhgRNPjKR8
America was founded on the promise of equality, liberty, and justice for all. We’ve never fully lived up to that promise — and we can’t rest until we finally do.
From ballot shortages and issues with machines to hours-long lines — what happened today in Georgia should enrage us all. We need to act now to prevent it from happening again in November. Our democracy depends on it. https://t.co/LLhBr8qVQw
Because of Donald Trump's negligence and incompetence:
 
- More than 110,000 people have died
- We have nearly 2 million cases of COVID-19
- Over 20 million Americans are out of work
 
And yet he’s patting himself on the back. Unbelievable.
Small businesses like Rafael's are the backbone of communities all across this nation. We have to do so much more to help them through this crisis. https://t.co/msi1oZ6P24
Let me be clear: We can't leave this moment and once again turn away and do nothing.
 
We need justice. We need action. We need reform.
Grief is a heavy burden to bear — and it's even harder with the eyes of the world watching. I know. But that burden is now a purpose — to change the world for the better in the name of George Floyd.

That's the message I shared with his loved ones during today's service: https://t.co/2LKJzwBUSO
My Dad used to say there's no greater sin than the abuse of power.

Whether it's an officer bloodying a peaceful protester or a President defending him with a conspiracy theory he saw on TV.

I'm a Catholic – just like Martin. Our faith says that we can't accept either.
13 million people who had jobs when you took office are unemployed today. https://t.co/ofW1fjXe3I
Together, let’s make this an era of action. https://t.co/JHt3sELUCV
This moment is a wake-up call for all of us. It's long past time we deal with systemic racism, growing economic inequality, and the denial of the promise of this nation to so many. https://t.co/IV4EVWAfRO
Donald Trump inherited the longest economic expansion in history from the Obama-Biden Administration, but like everything else he’s inherited, he has squandered it. https://t.co/395A6eJAzm
To everyone speaking out and peacefully demanding justice across the nation: I see you, I hear you, and I stand with you. https://t.co/gsqiDcEZUo
At every turn, President Trump ignored the experts, downplayed the threat COVID-19 posed, and misled the American people — and we’re all paying the price every single day. https://t.co/klaYVm3gpY
We've made incredible progress on LGBTQ+ equality, but we still have further to go. We can't rest until everyone is treated with dignity and respect under the law—regardless of who they are or whom they love.

Join #OutForBiden and let's get to work: https://t.co/UMiuglr9XX https://t.co/hHNVoCU2q5
We're facing some of the greatest challenges in our history, and Donald Trump is patting himself on the back. He just has no idea what’s really going on in this country.
 
It's time for him to step out of his bunker and look around at the consequences of his words and actions.
American history isn’t a fairytale with a guaranteed happy ending. But we have the power to write the future we want for this nation.

Don't let anyone tell you differently.
Donald Trump is the worst possible person to lead us through this moment.
Our nation is at an inflection point. We can choose four more years of Donald Trump's poisonous rhetoric and divisive politics — or we can take the next great step forward. https://t.co/AbLAYAUsZx
These disparities have plagued our nation for far too long. It’s time we rebuild our country upon more just and equal foundations — and finally close race-based wealth and income gaps. https://t.co/KforFaypAP
We need to build an economy that rewards work — not just wealth. https://t.co/NANxlpk538
This isn’t about politics. This is about the future of our country. Grateful for your support, Secretary Powell. https://t.co/0xLPyXiIPb
The words of a president matter. And time and time again, Donald Trump has callously used his to incite violence, stoke the flames of hatred and division, and drive us further apart.
 
We cannot give him another four years in the White House.
We need to stand up as a nation — with the Black community and with all minority communities — and come together as one America. Because the pain is too immense for one community to bear alone.
 
It is the duty of every American to grapple with it — and grapple with it now.
I promised George Floyd's family that he wouldn’t just become another hashtag — and I intend to keep that promise.
 
We need justice. And we need real police reform to ensure this never occurs again.
To all those families who are scared, and hurting, and wondering what’s going to happen next: I want you to know I see you. I won’t ever forget you. And I won’t be satisfied until this economy starts working for all of you. https://t.co/YxQ2OaeSyQ
Today, we honor those who answered duty’s call on June 6, 1944, on the beachheads of Normandy. We must be a living memorial to their bravery and sacrifice—and recognize always that our strength is rooted in our fervid and unfailing defense of democratic rights and freedoms. #DDay
Today, the pain is so raw it can be hard to keep faith that justice is at hand or that we will ever achieve the more perfect union we all want. But ours is a union worth fighting for, and we are all called to the cause. 

No one can stay silent. https://t.co/nZjQdJGKbD
Donald Trump was warned, but he failed to act. Now more than 20 million Americans are out of a job and paying the price. It didn’t have to be this bad. https://t.co/Hut7pquZUU
Folks, tonight we secured the 1,991 delegates needed to win the Democratic nomination. I'm going to spend every day fighting to earn your vote so that, together, we can win the battle for the soul of this nation. https://t.co/sl3wFGabpg
Tonight, I’m thinking of Breonna Taylor’s mother, Tamika Palmer. Today should have been her daughter's birthday. I've talked a lot about turning pain into purpose. But for Breonna and Tamika, it’s on us to find purpose. Our country needs to act — now. https://t.co/Ql2SyMew76
Donald Trump still doesn’t get it. He’s out there spiking the football — completely oblivious to the tens of millions of people who are facing the greatest struggle of their lives. https://t.co/ZNbTRsdVdS
This #GunViolenceAwarenessDay, I am reflecting on the life of Hadiya Pendleton, whose murder inspired the #WearOrange movement.

The hard truth is that Black Americans are ten times more likely to die by gun homicide. It has to stop.
When it comes to this economic crisis, Donald Trump either doesn’t know what’s going on, or he just doesn’t care. https://t.co/db8axnf704
Donald Trump is dangerously unfit to lead our nation through this moment. But don't just take my word for it: https://t.co/eD9z51pXDQ
George Floyd’s last words, “I can’t breathe,” have echoed across our nation and around the world.

For the President to try to put any other words in his mouth is frankly despicable. https://t.co/8dWu78dtGP
Tune in as I speak about the latest jobs report and the state of the economy: https://t.co/pfELb1jmqa
Those who have worked the closest with Donald Trump know how unfit he is to serve as President. https://t.co/MQ7aOKGic0
It is long past time we made the promise of this nation real for all of our people.
We are a nation in pain, but we must not allow this pain to destroy us.
 
We are a nation enraged, but we cannot allow our rage to consume us.
 
We are a nation exhausted, but we will not allow our exhaustion to defeat us.
We can’t take four more years of this.
To everyone struggling with mental health—you're not alone. There is no shame in seeking help, and there shouldn't be any barriers in your way to getting that help.
 
Together, we can achieve mental health parity, expand access to care, and wipe out the stigma. https://t.co/QXplsIwYTL
It's hard to believe this has to be said, but unlike this president, I’ll do my job and take responsibility. I won’t blame others. And I’ll never forget that the job isn’t about me — it’s about you.
We are at our best when we open our hearts, not when we clench our fists.
I wish I could say this hate began with Donald Trump and will end with him. It didn’t, and it won’t. American history isn’t a fairytale with a guaranteed happy ending.

It's up to all of us to create the America we know we can be. https://t.co/LNI2e3d3lz
More than 42 million Americans have now filed for unemployment in the last three months, and Black and Latino communities are being hit hardest. https://t.co/qXnKEf1JMF
The nation is crying out for leadership — but this president has nothing to offer.
Donald Trump has turned our country into a battlefield riven by old resentments and fresh fears. He thinks division helps him.

I ask every American to look at where we are now, and think anew: Is this who we are? Is this who we want to be? https://t.co/taSpWIFT1b
We need a president who listens. https://t.co/aBdClOSDYw
It’s in some of our darkest moments of despair that we’ve made some of our greatest progress — and we have that chance once again. We’re not just going to rebuild this nation — we’re going to transform it. 

There is nothing we can’t do if we do it together. https://t.co/iozMdaLtAw
If we stand together, we will rise stronger than before. A more equal, more just, more hopeful nation — closer to that more perfect union we must always strive to be.
I ask all of America — not to deny our pain or cover it over — but to use it to compel our nation across this turbulent threshold into the next phase of progress, inclusion, and opportunity for our great democracy.
If the Senate has time to confirm Donald Trump’s unqualified judicial nominees, it has time to pass legislation that will give true meaning to our Constitution’s promise of equal protection under the law.

No more excuses. No more delays.
When 100,000 Americans died because of his incompetent leadership, this president golfed.

When Americans peacefully protested outside the White House, this president tear-gassed them for a photo-op.

Donald Trump was elected to serve us all — but he only looks out for himself.
The presidency is a big job. Nobody will get everything right. I won’t either.

But I promise you this: I won’t traffic in fear and division or fan the flames of hate. I will seek to heal the racial wounds that have long plagued this country — not use them for political gain. https://t.co/TfNaoMRZQp
That’s what the presidency is: a duty of care — to all of us, not just our voters, not just our donors, but all of us. https://t.co/rWHywb5cHV
“I can’t breathe.”
 
George Floyd’s last words. But they didn’t die with him. They’re still being heard. They’re echoing across this nation.
 
It’s a wake-up call for all of us. https://t.co/q6kARnpJqU
Julián — I made a promise to George's family that he wouldn't just become another hashtag. We're going to tackle this head on — and we're going to need your help to do it. Grateful for your support. https://t.co/D0Ssv4hU2S
I’ve said from the outset of this election that we are in a battle for the soul of this nation.

Who we are. What we believe. And maybe most important—who we want to be. It’s all at stake.
 
That is truer today than ever. And it’s in this urgency we can find the path forward.
The President held up a bible at St. John’s church yesterday. If he opened it instead of brandishing it, he could have learned something: 

That we are all called to love one another as we love ourselves. 

That’s hard work. But it’s the work of America.
A country is crying out for leadership. Leadership that can unite us, leadership that brings us together, leadership that can recognize the pain and deep grief of communities that have had a knee on their neck for a long time.
Let us vow to make this, at last, an era of action to reverse systemic racism with long overdue and concrete changes.  This morning I'm speaking in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on where we are and where we need to go. Tune in: https://t.co/1bSdeXp8Rc
Pride is a global movement of love, self-expression, and community — resilient in the face of oppression and fear and hopeful for a better future. This month, let us recommit to those principles and remain steadfast in the fight for justice and equality. https://t.co/cNxsmEFW6R
He's using the American military against the American people.

He tear-gassed peaceful protesters and fired rubber bullets.

For a photo.

For our children, for the very soul of our country, we must defeat him. But I mean it when I say this: we can only do it together. https://t.co/G1yE67q9Nz
In this moment, the very soul of America is at stake.
 
We must commit, as a nation, to pursue justice with every ounce of our being.
 
We have to finally make real the American promise: That all men and women are not only equal at creation, but throughout their lives.
Leaders listen. https://t.co/FPSJP4Fkn3
After another night of unrest in America, I’m hosting a virtual roundtable with mayors from across the country to discuss where we go from here. Tune in: https://t.co/qyXzbDdSBq
We are a nation in pain right now, but we must not allow this pain to destroy us. 

As President, I will help lead this conversation — and more importantly, I will listen, just as I did today visiting the site of last night's protests in Wilmington. https://t.co/0h2ApbKT0C
We are a nation in pain, but we must not allow this pain to destroy us. We are a nation enraged, but we cannot allow our rage to consume us. Please stay safe. Please take care of each other. https://t.co/Y224rANwUF
Trump’s Tantrum Diplomacy is eroding U.S. credibility on the international stage. Withdrawing from @WHO during a global pandemic is a recipe for disaster and increases the cost of the American response. We must instead rally the world to confront COVID-19. https://t.co/rIlUewZNyI
If we are complacent, if we are silent, we are complicit in perpetuating these cycles of violence.

None of us can turn away. We all have an obligation to speak out.
You can't defeat bigotry; it only hides. And when leaders give it oxygen — as Donald Trump has done — it comes roaring back.

We all have a moral obligation to stand up, speak out, and hold people accountable. https://t.co/vES2aIXVGl
Today, in lifting our ambitions and our imaginations to the heavens, the United States has once more reshaped the future of space travel. https://t.co/AskxceOJJU
Every day that Donald Trump spends in the White House, he further debases the values and ideals of our nation. He is wholly unfit to be president. https://t.co/Fq90hSLuLz
This is no time for incendiary tweets. This is no time to encourage violence.

This is a national crisis — and we need real leadership right now.
We are a country with an open wound.

None of us can turn away. None of us can be silent. None of us any longer can hear those words — “I can’t breathe” — and do nothing.

We must commit, as a nation, to pursue justice with every ounce of our being. https://t.co/veodlR1UYU
It’s time for us to take a hard look at uncomfortable truths.

It’s time for us to face the deep, open wound we have in this nation.

We need justice for George Floyd.
I will be speaking more about the events in Minnesota later today.
I will not lift the President’s tweet. I will not give him that amplification. But he is calling for violence against American citizens during a moment of pain for so many. I’m furious, and you should be too.
This is not abstract: a black reporter was arrested while doing his job this morning, while the white police officer who killed George Floyd remains free. I am glad swift action was taken, but this, to me, says everything.
Enough.
We can’t allow this crisis to exacerbate the disparities that plague our nation. https://t.co/QlV2tdEDfm
We’re months into this crisis, and Donald Trump still doesn't have an effective national testing strategy.

Ordinary people doing extraordinary things. That's the story of America — and we’re seeing it written every single day. It gives me hope. https://t.co/hK8AbPKZue
100,000+ lives lost across the country.
1,700,000+ confirmed U.S. cases.
40,000,000+ unemployment claims filed.

Donald Trump has failed our nation.
Today, we learned that another 2.1 million people filed for unemployment last week, bringing the total number of new claims since this crisis began to more than 40 million. It's just the latest evidence of Donald Trump’s utter failure of leadership. https://t.co/YSHGLBdMLG
Thirty years ago, I proudly cosponsored the landmark Americans with Disabilities Act. It was an enormous step forward, but there's more work to do. So today, I’m releasing my plan to achieve full participation and equality for people with disabilities: https://t.co/psuNvKzYej
The hard truth is that this crisis didn’t have to be this bad.

There are moments in our history so grim, so heart-rending, that they're forever fixed in each of our hearts as shared grief. Today is one of those moments. 100,000 lives have now been lost to this virus.

To those hurting, I'm so sorry for your loss. The nation grieves with you. https://t.co/SBBRKV4mPZ
Over the last few months, countless Asian Americans have been threatened, attacked, and blamed for COVID-19. They've cruelly been made the scapegoat by the most powerful man on the planet, President Trump. It has to end.

We’re in the middle of a global pandemic — and not only is Donald Trump preventing people from getting the health insurance they need, but he’s also actively trying to terminate the insurance millions already have.

Last year California passed #AB5, affording gig workers protections and benefits like a minimum wage and overtime pay.

Now, gig economy giants are trying to gut the law and exempt their workers. It's unacceptable.

I urge Californians to vote no on the initiative this November.
George Floyd deserved better and his family deserves justice. His life mattered.

I'm grateful for the swift action in Minneapolis to fire the officers involved — they must be held responsible for their egregious actions. The FBI should conduct a thorough investigation. https://t.co/n1tdiUba0x
Wear a mask.
Donald Trump's wealthy donors got tens of millions of dollars in relief, while countless small businesses were turned away. It's no wonder he didn't want any oversight.

We need a government that works for all — not just the super-wealthy.
The truth is asking for money is the worst part of running for president—especially in times as tough as these. But we’re coming up on our end of month fundraising deadline, and I need your help to ensure we hit our goal.

1 in 4 U.S. workers has filed for unemployment benefits in the last 10 weeks. It’s a crisis unlike anything we’ve seen in our lifetime — and the Trump Administration is failing to do enough to help.
Folks, today we’re launching #League46⚾️ — a next generation coalition ready to make Donald Trump a one-term president. We've got unlimited capacity to create change — and together, we’re going to transform this country.

Join today: https://t.co/Rnwttcaugo https://t.co/Dbez4mtrwx
So much of this could have been prevented if we had a president who listened to someone other than himself.
We are months into this crisis, and Donald Trump still doesn't have a comprehensive plan when it comes to COVID-19 or the economy. It's unacceptable. I released a detailed plan laying out what I would do months ago, and have built on it since. Take a look: https://t.co/xjxsDn2qCD
There’s not a single thing the American people can’t do if we do it together.
We have always been able to take crises and turn them into opportunities — and we have the chance to do that once again. If we match our ambitions to the scale of the challenges we face, we can and will transform our country for generations to come.
This ruling goes a long way toward protecting the sacred right to vote, but there's still work to do. We've got to ensure everyone — including individuals formerly incarcerated for felonies — has the right to make their voice heard at the ballot box. https://t.co/yMzAz3NU5u
To all the members of our military and our military families, especially those who have lost their service member, thank you. We owe you. We can never lessen the magnitude of your loss, but this I can promise you: we will never forget. #MemorialDay https://t.co/b5vDrYiPL5
The presidency is about a lot more than tweeting from your golf cart. It requires taking on the ultimate responsibility for the biggest decisions in the world. Donald Trump simply wasn’t prepared for that. I promise you I will be.
Climate change poses an existential threat to our future — and time is running out to address it. We have to get Donald Trump out of the White House and tackle the challenge head-on.
Hunger today isn’t about scarcity — it’s about a massive failure in leadership.

Donald Trump has failed to live up to our trust and treaty obligations to Native Americans. It’s unacceptable.

I’ll make meaningful investments in Indian Country — including increasing funding for Indian Health Services and making that funding mandatory. https://t.co/JIObym7aXI
We can protect the sacred right to vote and protect public health at the same time.
The hard truth is Donald Trump ignored the warnings of health experts and intelligence agencies, downplayed the threat COVID-19 posed, and failed to take the action needed to combat the outbreak.

It’s one of the greatest failures of presidential leadership in our history.
36,000 Americans could be alive today if President Trump had acted sooner. Let's put that into perspective: https://t.co/i2bmqRe86r
We're in the midst of the worst economic crisis in our lifetime, and Senate Republicans continue to delay relief for the American people saying, I don’t see the need right now. Unbelievable.

Donald Trump has failed to provide for our nurses and doctors on the frontlines. Now he’s short-changing our troops and their families. Unacceptable. https://t.co/Q3s1MvHwQX
Now more than ever, we need a president who will choose to unite rather than divide.
When we emerge from this crisis, we can’t just go back to the way things were before. We need to take this country to a place we’ve never been. Where we finally live up to our highest ideals and everyone gets a full share of the American dream.
Congratulations to Dr. @iingwen on the start of her second term. Taiwan’s thriving democracy and response to COVID-19 are an example to the world. America’s support for Taiwan must remain strong, principled, and bipartisan. https://t.co/82aw9TFh8z
The United States of America has always emerged stronger from every trial and tribulation — and we will again. We will overcome this.
Fundamentally, this is about whose side the government is on and whether it is accountable to the American people. This is a case I will continue to make, and if elected president will deliver on. https://t.co/x19ZeMOz4v
That's exactly why @EWarren and I have called for more oversight. We need more conditions on corporations to ensure relief goes to their workers, not their CEOs. No $500 billion slush fund. No blank checks. The Trump Administration is prioritizing big corporations over workers.
During today’s Senate Banking Committee hearing, Secretary @StevenMnuchin1 refused to require corporations benefiting from $500 billion in CARES Act funds to keep workers on their payrolls. @EWarren asked him several times, each time he ducked and refused.
Today, @DrBiden and I are mourning the death of our dear friend, Annie Glenn. Her long life was filled with great love and great meaning, with purpose and her own brand of uncommon courage. https://t.co/JnAuBlF41P

It’s time we reward the people who actually make this country work. Not Wall Street CEOs — but the middle class. Ordinary women and men who are capable of doing extraordinary things when given half a chance.

That's who I'll fight for every single day in the White House.
Donald Trump is not responsible for the coronavirus. But he does bear full responsibility for failing to protect our nation from the worst public health and economic crisis in our lifetime.
With your help, we'll defeat Donald Trump. And we won't just rebuild this nation — we’ll transform it. I know times are tough, but if you're able, please chip in today to help make it happen: https://t.co/Wje8LYRL0J
One of President Trump's top advisors admitted that this administration really let the country down on testing.

He's right. It's long past time for Trump to step up and implement a national testing strategy so we can begin safely reopening the economy. https://t.co/jDawbgdAzl
#NAME?
Companies getting relief from taxpayers have an obligation to protect workers' paychecks, and the Trump Administration has an obligation to hold their feet to the fire to ensure they do.

We need real relief paired with real oversight—not no-strings-attached corporate bailouts. https://t.co/N7MlkNODqh
Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in modern American history — and his recovery efforts are making that clearer than ever.
In the middle of the worst public health crisis in our lifetime, President Trump is actively trying to terminate health insurance for millions of Americans. It's unthinkable.

Here's what I would do to ensure everyone has access to the coverage they need: https://t.co/7kvok6B6if
In times of crisis, Americans stand as one. It's who we are. And it's how we're going to get through this — together.
A year ago today, the House passed the #EqualityAct, a long-overdue bill that would ensure LGBTQ+ people are treated with dignity and respect under the law. But @SenateMajLdr won't bring it up for a vote. It's unacceptable.

Passing it will be a top legislative priority of mine.
I'm incredibly grateful for everyone who has chipped in to help fuel this campaign — especially in times as tough as these. @EWarren and I called a few folks to thank them for their support: https://t.co/FPpttl2wkc
As we reflect on the incredible legacy of Brown v. Board of Education, we’re reminded of the urgent work that remains before us 66 years later. We can’t rest until every kid gets a fair shot, and we finally live up to our founding ideals of liberty, justice, and equality for all.
Moments of crisis require presidents to step up, transcend partisan politics, and unite the nation to achieve a common goal. But Donald Trump has done nothing but stoke division—and we're seeing the effect every day. He is the worst possible person to lead us through this crisis. https://t.co/PEArBTK2id

Unions like @GoIUPAT are supporting their workers and communities during this pandemic. To build a stronger, more inclusive, and more resilient middle class after this crisis, we must encourage unionization. That starts with enacting the PRO Act. https://t.co/JbZbXnGHfx
Los fracasos internacionales de Trump han abierto el camino para que Cuba se una al Consejo de Derechos Humanos de la ONU. Esto traiciona a los presos políticos en Cuba y mina aún más la diplomacia de los EE.UU. Como presidente, defenderé los derechos humanos del pueblo cubano.
Trump's international failures have cleared a path for Cuba to join the UN Human Rights Council. This would betray Cuba's political prisoners and further undermine U.S. diplomacy. As President, I will lead by empowering the Cuban people and defending human rights.
To everyone who has lost a loved one due to COVID-19: I know it's incredibly difficult right now, but there will come a time when their memory brings a smile to your lips before it brings a tear to your eye.

Not only does the Trump Administration want to take away health coverage for millions in the middle of a pandemic, but now they want to let people go hungry, too. Their cruelty truly knows no bounds. https://t.co/12JpuMOXEH
Moments of crisis require swift and decisive action from our leaders, but Donald Trump and his administration have done nothing but dither and delay. They have failed the American people on every single front. https://t.co/Bl4104WqEG
I would trust the guy who’s one of our nation's top public health experts, not the one who pondered injecting disinfectant into the body and looked directly at a solar eclipse. https://t.co/nMJz1nogpW
Enough with the anger and division and fear-mongering, Mr. President. It's time for you to step up, appeal to our better angels, and unite the country. We'll overcome this crisis by coming together — not by tearing each other apart. https://t.co/jySlLNWoHG

That’s the plan.

Here's the deal: We can choose who our country works for. We can choose whether it works for just the wealthy — or everyone else as well.

That’s the choice we must make — all of us together — this November.
Let me be clear: My Administration will review every single stimulus loan given to big companies and political insiders. We will find any dollar taken corruptly, we will come get it, and we will punish the wrongdoers. https://t.co/UVQILUeTVN
I believe everyone deserves a fair shot at success — not just the Mar-a-Lago crowd.
Donald Trump just doesn't understand: We have an economic crisis because we have a public health crisis — and we have a public health crisis because he failed to act. https://t.co/hRrueGgx2C
In April, we raised $60.5 million between my campaign and @TheDemocrats. I'm humbled and know what a sacrifice it is to give in times as difficult as these. But May is our most important month yet, and we need your help. If you can, please chip in today: https://t.co/HbZYJWVJUs
Donald Trump and his team seem to understand how critical testing is to their own safety. So why are they insisting that it’s unnecessary for the American people?
With folks staying at home during this time of social distancing, we put together some fun activities to keep everyone entertained. Text FREE to 30330 to be the first to get a look at what we’ve been working on. https://t.co/7dDXj3dPCm
Donald Trump hopes to split us into dueling camps, casting Democrats as doomsayers hoping to keep America grounded and Republicans as freedom fighters trying to liberate the economy.

It’s a childish tactic—and a false choice none of us should fall for. https://t.co/Kr8CYerAT3
I have a better idea: give people coronavirus economic relief and don't hold their hard-earned benefits hostage. https://t.co/b8cT22xGfd
This crisis presents an opportunity to not just rebuild our economy — but transform it. @AndrewYang joined me to discuss how we can do that and create a stronger, fairer, more inclusive middle class.

Listen to the full episode: https://t.co/lQ9ghwJVgt https://t.co/3GaBdN1S46
No podemos callar ante la violencia contra personas transgénero de color, como las recientes tragedias en Missouri y Puerto Rico. Es nuestra obligación garantizar que todos puedan vivir abiertamente, con orgullo y sin miedo. https://t.co/CPmqT4kYxe
We cannot be silent in the face of rising violence against transgender people of color—like the recent tragedies in Missouri and Puerto Rico. It's our moral obligation to end this epidemic, and ensure everyone can live open and proud and free from fear. https://t.co/CPmqT4kYxe
.@AndrewYang and I covered a lot of ground on the next episode of Here's the Deal, but the most surprising part might have been learning about his connection to the Roosevelts.

Make sure to tune in for the full episode tomorrow morning: https://t.co/gfVHzRcDXo https://t.co/oYcWnZXWM8
Don't let anyone tell you differently: We have the power to write the future we want for our country.
Tax cuts for the super-wealthy.
Bailouts for large corporations.
Working Americans left behind.

That’s Donald Trump’s record. https://t.co/5ThHy2Gqdx
I believe rebuilding the middle class is the moral obligation of our time. We have to build a stronger, more inclusive, more resilient middle class — one that can withstand the next public health crisis or whatever else comes our way. https://t.co/wxXgzR0U9I
Ordinary people, given half a chance, have never let their country down.

That’s who I believe in. That’s who I’m in this race to fight for.
To the extraordinary mothers everywhere, like Catherine Eugenia Finnegan Biden, my wishes for a safe and happy Mother’s Day. https://t.co/3PmotUx6EU
There's a clear choice this November:

Donald Trump will do everything he can to terminate health care for millions in a global pandemic.

I will do everything I can to ensure every American has access to the quality, affordable care they need. https://t.co/ziqbBhFmzU
There’s no quit in America. None at all. We’re going to get through this — and we're going to come out stronger.
This is inexcusable. https://t.co/Ep61Pqhmhe
No one should pay a dollar out of pocket for coronavirus testing or treatment. Period. https://t.co/HTc0fF1Ydi
Imagine what we could be doing now with the $2 trillion in tax cuts that Donald Trump delivered for his rich friends. https://t.co/5yDjitm4l2
We need to rebuild the backbone of this country — the middle class. And this time, we're going to bring everyone along.

We have to make sure every single person gets a fair shot at success.
Crisis reveals character — and character belongs in the White House. https://t.co/5XD4rtjNDL
Ahmaud Arbery was shot down in cold blood. His family deserves justice — and they deserve it now. https://t.co/YkXBvYIJNw
Make no mistake: COVID-19 has caused a massive economic challenge. But this crisis hit us harder, and will last longer, because Donald Trump spent the last three years undermining the core pillars of our economic strength. https://t.co/4nkrpNDXgs
Two years ago, Donald Trump withdrew from the Iran Deal. This week, he vetoed a war powers resolution that would've prevented him from starting a war with Iran without Congressional consent. His decisions have increased the risk of war in the Middle East. https://t.co/Tq0CU99A1r
Corruption is a feature of Donald Trump's economic agenda—not a bug. He will pick his wealthy friends and corporate cronies over working families every time.

I say it’s time we pick a different way—one where everyone gets a fair shot at success, not just the Mar-a-Lago crowd. https://t.co/9MbZpSblC5
75 years ago on #VEDay, America and its allies defeated fascism in Europe. From the devastation of war, we built a lasting peace. Today, as we honor the veterans who sacrificed for us, let us remember the importance of uniting against common threats.
It didn’t have to be this bad. The hard truth is that Donald Trump was simply not up to the job. https://t.co/sUd5GjD6cl
I’m the proud husband of a teacher who inspires me every day. I’ve seen firsthand how hard teachers work with little support and few resources. Thank you to all the amazing teachers who've inspired and educated the future of our country. #TeacherAppreciationWeek https://t.co/1sq1isIOWr
Wouldn't it be nice to have a president who listens to someone other than himself? https://t.co/IN2Wtpacc4
Donald Trump loves to crow about what a great economy he built.

This crisis has revealed what a failure Trumponomics has been. And American workers and families are paying the price. 

Tune in for my remarks live on @nowthisnews at 12 PM EDT.
Here's the simple truth: The United States of America has never been defeated when we're together — and we're not going to be defeated now.

We can and will overcome this.
I can't hit the campaign trail in-person due to COVID-19 — so instead, I’m traveling across the country from my home in Delaware. Head over to my Instagram to catch up on today’s trip to Florida 📲.
Where are the tests, Mr. President? https://t.co/thdbTtLOZC
Every step of the way, President Trump has ignored the experts, downplayed the threat COVID-19 posed, and misled the American people — and we’re all paying the price every single day.

I promise you, I will do the opposite. https://t.co/lok9PvaaFJ
Over 33 million Americans have filed unemployment claims since mid-March — one out of every five workers. It’s a national economic disaster that requires urgent action. We have to get help to everyone who needs it — efficiently, equitably, and immediately. https://t.co/6wOUCo8Dj8
Real presidents lead. Reality TV presidents don’t. https://t.co/2lMwnRXLcG
I believe the moral obligation of our time is to rebuild our economy in a way that finally brings everyone along. A Biden Administration will encourage the economic empowerment of African Americans and close the racial wealth and income gaps.

These folks are true heroes — every single one of them.

Take a minute to read their stories: https://t.co/BU2eCifWhZ
We can't host any in-person events due to COVID-19, but that won't stop me from hitting the campaign trail—virtually, of course. Tomorrow, I'll be making stops around Florida and wrapping up the day with a virtual rally in Tampa.

Tune in at 5:15 PM ET: https://t.co/xk0GcSpr50 https://t.co/H3ZAyxhxxj
I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: No one is expendable. No life is worth losing to add one more point to the Dow.
The nurses on the front lines of this crisis are American heroes. We owe them more than we could ever repay, but we can start by ensuring they have the protective equipment they need to stay safe, emergency paid sick leave, and premium pay. #NationalNursesDay
You heard it straight from the president himself: He wants to terminate health care for millions of Americans in the middle of a global pandemic.

We can't let that happen. https://t.co/OD1rdn8yiz
The stakes in this election have never been higher. Over the last few months, we've seen how wholly unfit Donald Trump is to lead our nation.

We have to vote him out of the White House this November.
We can’t sit by as Donald Trump and Republicans use COVID-19 as an excuse to disenfranchise voters. We need to ensure people have the opportunity to vote by mail, early vote, vote absentee and, in every way possible, safely vote in person this November. https://t.co/uKRyR3LVTA
These stories are heartbreaking and remind us that the numbers we see in the news are more than just statistics. Every death is a tragedy and marks a family and community that will never be the same. @DrBiden and I are keeping them all in our prayers. 
https://t.co/ajYHuY6VN2
The video is clear: Ahmaud Arbery was killed in cold blood. My heart goes out to his family, who deserve justice and deserve it now. It is time for a swift, full, and transparent investigation into his murder. https://t.co/alvY5WjdHx
This didn't have to happen. The Trump Administration failed to take action and produce desperately needed protective equipment — and those on the front lines of this crisis paid the price. It's heartbreaking. https://t.co/7bOj3POJCT
The Biden Administration will not silence scientists. https://t.co/BPXMeavONA
The choice between the economy and public health is a false one—if we don’t beat the virus, we'll never get back to full economic strength and will lose countless lives. We have to get the number of new cases down and scale up testing before we return to some sense of normalcy. https://t.co/N7UT3WtNPK
It’s important to stay connected while we’re social distancing — but there’s always that one friend who doesn’t get the hint when it’s time to end the video chat. 

Glad we don’t know anyone like that — right, @KeeganMKey? https://t.co/AoDEYRTo8G
It's been a big few weeks. President Obama, Secretary Clinton, Senator Sanders, Senator Warren, and Speaker Pelosi all endorsed our campaign. Now, we need your help to keep the momentum going.

I know times are tough, but if you can, please chip in today: https://t.co/D4S84E6v2Z
Each week, I get hundreds of letters from people across the country. Folks share their hopes, ideas, struggles, and concerns — and I try to respond to as many as I can. We're going to share a few of them with you in our new series: Sincerely, Joe. https://t.co/HOHwdCcY1h
Thank you to all the:

Firefighters
Paramedics
Police officers
Doctors
Nurses
Medical support staff
Grocery and retail workers
Meatpackers
Delivery drivers
Transit workers
And everyone else on the front lines of this fight.

You truly are the heart and soul of this country.
Let me be clear: Essential workers on the front lines of this crisis deserve premium pay, emergency paid sick leave, and protections that keep them safe.
Across the country, folks are stepping up, taking care of their neighbors, and lending a hand to those in need. It's who we are. In times of crisis, we stand as one. And it makes me so proud to be an American. https://t.co/nXxczgOfAZ
Today, I’m releasing a new plan to achieve equity for the African American community and take us one step closer to making America what it ought to be. Read more: https://t.co/ub49jLMI9M
Over 1 million cases of COVID-19. Almost 70,000 dead. What is upsetting President Trump? Tough questions from the press.

Cry me a river, Mr. President. https://t.co/MbSZJ0UMel
Make no mistake: We can emerge from this crisis a stronger, better, and fairer nation. It’s within our power — we just need a president and an administration who are up for the task.
I've always believed that we've been at our best when we've acted as one America. This crisis is an opportunity for us to be that nation again. There's not a single thing we cannot accomplish if we do it together.
In times of crisis, the American people deserve a president who tells them the truth and takes responsibility. Donald Trump has not been that president. https://t.co/QikZiHZeXX
The hard truth is that it didn’t have to be this bad. The lack of preparation, the slow response on testing, the failure to administer the relief in the CARES Act appropriately — all of it stems from Donald Trump’s failures as president. https://t.co/d7XZvkJKXP
This Sunday night, settle in and join labor leader Dolores Huerta, actor John Leguizamo, Secretary Hilda Solis, and Congresswoman Escobar for a #TodosConBiden discussion. Tune in now: https://t.co/o7qCPrYivT
The American people are strong, tough, brave, and big-hearted. We can and will overcome this — together.
Donald Trump seems to think he can direct funding based on which politicians are nice to him, which states he’s trying to win in November, and which businesses he wants to enrich — all without any accountability. @EWarren and I think that’s unacceptable. https://t.co/wbEcnkBzj1
This #WorldPressFreedomDay, support for an independent press at home and around the world matters more than ever. We must vote Trump out this November and assure that attacks on our free press are never again acceptable — especially not in the White House. https://t.co/Ga8zWYphOg
Trump deflects legitimate questions with attacks. He bullies members of the press, instead of taking responsibility for his failures. His efforts to undermine public confidence in the integrity of reporting violate our core values and threaten our very system of government.
A free press is essential to a free society. That's why attacking the press and attempting to intimidate independent media is a standard part of the authoritarian playbook around the world. And it’s why Donald Trump’s efforts to demonize the media put us on such a dangerous path.
The U.S. Postal Service is an essential pillar of American life. We simply cannot let Donald Trump destroy it. https://t.co/1W4W6LkMum
Over the last few weeks, I worked with our supporters and staff to create a code for our campaign—the principles we’ll live by, reflecting the community we’ve built, the team we aspire to be, and some of my own ‘rules’ as well.

I’m excited to share it: https://t.co/odsoUFxPmd https://t.co/ulwQwEosTz
This pandemic is bigger than any one individual or country. This moment requires all of us to come together — across the nation and around the world — to solve this crisis.
When I say Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in modern American history, this is what I'm talking about.

Monty Bennett should return the tens of millions of dollars he received, and we should give it to the small businesses that need it. https://t.co/CV5NqlreSs
We left a playbook. He ignored it.

We created an office to prepare for pandemics. He gutted it.

We had CDC officials in China to detect and contain outbreaks. He pulled them out.

Trump can try and shift blame all he wants, but the fact is his actions left us unprepared. https://t.co/NdsINZ307m
Mi corazón y el de Jill están con Puerto Rico a raíz de los terremotos de hoy. Mientras la isla enfrenta el impacto de este suceso y la pandemia del COVID-19 tenemos que asegurarnos que reciban los recursos y la asistencia que necesitan para recuperarse lo más pronto posible.
My heart and Jill's are with the people of Puerto Rico in the wake of another damaging earthquake. As the island grapples with both the impact of this earthquake and this pandemic, we need to ensure they get the resources and assistance needed to recover as soon as possible.
To @USWNT: don’t give up this fight. This is not over yet.

To @USSoccer: equal pay, now. Or else when I'm president, you can go elsewhere for World Cup funding. https://t.co/XK6t9oM94k
On March 6th, Donald Trump said: “Anybody that wants a test can get a test.”

It was a lie then, and it's still not true nearly two months later. It's a disgrace, and it's slowing efforts to reopen safely.

This administration needs to act immediately to surge testing nationwide.
When we come together and act as one America, there's not a single thing we cannot accomplish.
No one should have to pay for coronavirus treatment. Period. https://t.co/GBchrVZmDz
I'll say what Donald Trump won't: The Confederate flag, swastikas, and other symbols of hate that have been used in these protests have no place in America. The president should encourage folks to follow Gov. Whitmer’s public health orders — not sow further discord and division. https://t.co/fZrHELiXVh
As we mark the beginning of Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, @DrBiden and I extend our best wishes to AANHPI communities across America. We look forward to celebrating your extraordinary accomplishments and contributions in the month ahead.
When we emerge from this crisis, we can't just go back to the way things were before. We have to build a better future for all.

We can and will transform this nation — together.
This crisis isn't about you, Mr. President. It's about the American people. https://t.co/3a4ppJ964Y
We need more tests. Our front line workers need protective equipment. Americans need additional economic relief.

Yet the Trump Administration is spending time and energy on President Trump's wasteful border wall.

Unbelievable. https://t.co/RY12LJAYGS
The number is overwhelming, but each one represents a life thrown into uncertainty, a family unable to make ends meet, and a community worried about how it will recover.

We have to do more to help them. Now. https://t.co/TBtbqj5Kbw
- More than 60,000 people in the U.S. have died
- 30 million have filed for unemployment
- At least 1 million have gotten sick

Enough with the late night Twitter tantrums, Mr. President. It's time for you to step up and lead.
Instead of preparing our country to fight COVID-19, Donald Trump wasted months and promised it would miraculously go away by April.

He was wrong. And we're all paying the price. https://t.co/R0tDbI1WZr
An open and independent press is more important than ever in times like this. They deserve to be treated with respect — not belittled with schoolyard taunts from this president. https://t.co/eIiJO6uJfr
Donald Trump either read his daily briefings and ignored the warnings, or didn't read them at all. Either way, it's a complete and unjustifiable dereliction of duty. https://t.co/LVzlxWFTAd
I’ve been a big fan of Megan’s for years and can’t wait to join her this afternoon. You can watch our chat live at 2:45 PM ET: https://t.co/RQzAg1XvVf https://t.co/tLxJeqr1w3
We may be physically apart, but we are all in this together. https://t.co/VNiMtbfItu
As president, I promise you I'll honor all those we've lost from COVID-19. https://t.co/9N00PTSNHw
The climate emergency isn't just a threat to our environment, it's a threat to our health, economy, and so much more. We have to get Donald Trump out of the White House and take action to combat it before it's too late. https://t.co/08paP9Ii3C
In the middle of a global pandemic, the Trump Administration is still working to gut the Affordable Care Act and rip health care away from millions. It's morally reprehensible.

They need to drop the lawsuit immediately. https://t.co/yc6azeqLVs
With rent due in a few days and folks across the country worried they won't be able to make their payments, it's clear more needs to be done to provide relief. We need to freeze rent immediately for people who have lost their jobs and place a temporary ban on evictions.
The words of a president matter — and Donald Trump has used his to downplay COVID-19, pass blame onto others, and mislead the American people. I will do the opposite. https://t.co/6ZViv3tdW7
The Trump Admin failed to provide enough testing, PPE, and safety enforcement. Workers have gotten sick, plants have closed, and the meat supply is at risk. It's past time workers have the protections they need to stay healthy and do their job safely. https://t.co/tD0Rc7P4mJ
I wish he were president right now, but I can't wait until he is if all of us do our part to support the kind of person that we want back in the White House. — @HillaryClinton

Join us: https://t.co/gnaFCACYrW https://t.co/xyy85Q0R6e
Wear a mask in public.
Read your daily briefings.
Listen to the experts.

This really isn't rocket science. It's common sense.
Throughout our history, we have emerged from every crisis stronger than before — and we will again.
We owe a profound debt of gratitude to the health care workers on the front lines of this fight. I checked in with Monica, an ICU Nurse, to talk about how she's getting through this and to thank her for all she's doing: https://t.co/PLuEZWO5aQ
I couldn't agree with @HillaryClinton more. We need a president who will listen to the science, bring us together, and lead with compassion and heart. If I have the honor of being elected, that's the exact kind of president I will be. https://t.co/g7z1C8SH7e
Let me be very clear: No one is expendable.

We shouldn’t allow rationing of health care that discriminates based on age or disability.
The fact is there has been so much unnecessary death in this country. If we had listened to the experts and heeded their warnings, it could have been stopped short. But Donald Trump failed to act — and now the American people are paying the price. https://t.co/oXeANYvD7T
I’ve known @HillaryClinton for years, and know that her dedication and passion for bettering our country are second to none. I’m grateful for her endorsement and for her friendship — and look forward to working alongside her to get Donald Trump out of the White House. https://t.co/rv3BuW2BUx
COVID-19 is affecting the entire nation, but the impact doesn’t look the same for everyone. I'm hosting a town hall on how COVID-19 is impacting women — and I'll be joined by special guest Hillary Clinton. Tune in now to watch: https://t.co/sQBaHGHgRQ
If you're excited too, join us at 3 PM ET: https://t.co/xk0GcSpr50
(I'm with her.) https://t.co/jLPeaGv5Mo
We're months into this crisis and workers still don't have enough protective equipment, there still aren't enough tests, and the death toll continues to rise.

The President should spend less time congratulating himself and more time doing his job. https://t.co/lVJAcHySwH
We are months into this crisis, and health care workers still don’t have the protective equipment they need. It’s a national disgrace. https://t.co/WnSdlPfJYR

The Trump Administration could have helped prevent this. But once again, they failed to take action — and now the American people are paying the price. https://t.co/OzNIJpxn2k
Testing is the springboard we need to help get our economy safely up and running again. Trump could rapidly scale it up. He hasn’t. Instead, he’s passed blame and pushed sole responsibility to governors.

We've got to do better. https://t.co/qtjjC5shEJ

We want our country to get moving and healthy again. But we must take the necessary, rational steps, grounded in science, to do so safely, so COVID-19 doesn’t come roaring back. https://t.co/ivYeRgrf4q
I'm incredibly honored by @SpeakerPelosi's endorsement and grateful for her historic leadership in Congress. 

Together, we helped pass Obamacare and together we can not only bring this country back from the brink from this current crisis, but transform it. https://t.co/nJG599w7lU
America has always met every big challenge with an even bigger solution — this moment should be no different. We need an infrastructure program that will combat climate change and create good-paying jobs at the same time.
Wealthy firms with ties to Trump got millions, while countless small businesses were turned away. No wonder he wanted no one to watch how the money was deployed.

The American people deserve rigorous oversight — and small businesses deserve relief. Now. https://t.co/UNBLt4g5R9
The American people are stepping up and rising to meet this moment. It's time for our president to do the same.
Now more than ever, we need a president who will choose hope over fear, unity over division, truth over lies, and science over fiction. https://t.co/RmUuKLc70X
Imagine the future we can build with Donald Trump out of the White House. A future where:

- Health care is a right
- We combat climate change
- We end our gun violence epidemic
- Our government works for all — not just the powerful

Let’s build that future, together.
The workers on the front lines of this crisis are risking their lives every day to combat COVID-19 and keep this country running. The least we can do is provide them the pay and protection they need and deserve. https://t.co/cL67OThz8m
366 days ago, we launched this campaign.

192 days from now, we’ll beat Donald Trump.

Let’s go win this thing, together. https://t.co/yDbpcKgXwZ
@carobrissett @pizzahut I bet this made their day. Thank you for stepping up and doing what you can to help those on the front lines of this fight.
@Emmieinthecity Michelle, this is a great idea. Thank you for doing what you can to ensure folks have the masks they need to stay safe.
@Im4fit Julie, I can’t thank you enough for all you’re doing to ensure folks have food and supplies during this crisis.
@a_zinsner8 @TeamJoe This is great, Addie. Tell your mom and sister I say thank you for lending a helping hand to your neighbors.
@AmandaLinton23 @templehospital Amanda, this is remarkable. Thank you for stepping up and supporting our front line heroes. I know the staff will greatly appreciate your donations.
Today, folks across the nation have showed their compassion by participating in our first ever #SOULSaturday.  Tune in now as we end the day with a celebration for our campaign’s one year anniversary: https://t.co/69XYQrqkzx
One year ago, we launched this campaign. Whether you were on #TeamJoe from day one or have joined in recent weeks — I’m incredibly grateful for your support and hope I make you proud. Together, we’re going to beat Donald Trump, unite this country, and transform our nation.
It’s stories like these that make me so proud to be an American and make me confident that we will overcome this. Because there’s nothing the American people have been unable to accomplish when we do it together.
After seeing the shortage of masks around the country, Marilyn decided to step up and organize efforts in Northern Virginia to make homemade masks. Because of her selfless work, countless front line workers have the masks they need to stay safe.
Older adults are especially vulnerable to COVID-19. Recognizing that, Erica decided to organize youth in her community to buy groceries for seniors — ensuring they receive the food they need while staying safe at home. She's a true hero.
Brien usually works at the Ford Plant in Rawsonville, Michigan, driving a semi. But when the plant started assembling much-needed ventilators, he courageously stepped up and volunteered to help. His selfless actions will no doubt save countless lives.
John, a Facilities Maintainer from Staten Island, recently contracted and survived the coronavirus. Shortly after he recovered, a colleague contracted the virus and needed plasma to battle it. John heroically stepped up and donated his plasma to help his coworker.
Across the country, people are stepping up and doing incredible things amid this pandemic. It’s who we are as Americans—in times of crisis, we stand as one. For #SOULSaturday, I called a few folks to thank them for all they’re doing. Here are some of their stories:
Tonight, we’re hosting a #SOULSaturday rally to celebrate the one-year anniversary of our campaign! Join us at 7 PM ET: https://t.co/xk0GcSpr50 https://t.co/3Bk3Dmml9e
We may be physically apart, but folks across the country are coming together to check in on their neighbors and thank our front line heroes. Use #SOULSaturday to show how you’re participating today. https://t.co/2IXqofhlao
When I announced my campaign one year ago today, I said we were in a battle for the soul of the nation.

One year later, that is as true as it has ever been. I believe we can and we will emerge from this crisis a stronger, better, and fairer nation. Together, as one America. https://t.co/OpLWsvUc39
Donald Trump needs to step up and do everything he can to give our front line workers the protective equipment they need. https://t.co/pSTfvFlyQ7
I know times are tough, but we have to campaign as hard as ever to take the strongest fight possible to Donald Trump. He has a lot more money than us, and we need your help to close the gap.

If you can, please chip in today: https://t.co/W6pXlZBfdN
Folks, to celebrate the one-year anniversary of our campaign, we'll be hosting a #SOULSaturday Rally tomorrow night! We may be physically apart, but I hope you'll join us in coming together at 7 PM ET: https://t.co/xk0GcSpr50 https://t.co/fA5ouDt4Ji
The health of the American people is not a joke, Mr. President. https://t.co/4jjYlULrxA
I can’t believe I have to say this, but please don’t drink bleach.
Let me be clear: This crisis isn’t about you, Mr. President. https://t.co/w6Ntdc5pEy
Today, we remember the atrocities faced by the Armenian people in the Metz Yeghern — the Armenian Genocide. If elected, I pledge to support a resolution recognizing the Armenian Genocide and will make universal human rights a top priority. https://t.co/Afl5lMLPR3
No matter who you supported throughout the primary, I want you to know that you have a home in our campaign. You’re not just wanted — you’re needed. Together, we will beat Donald Trump and transform this nation.

Join us: https://t.co/gnaFCAUzju https://t.co/Yj1Ua9m8Aq
These folks are American heroes. https://t.co/dkmOTskx8x
I know this is a dark time for so many people, just know that we will get through this. We will emerge from this crisis stronger than ever before. https://t.co/42QY9zGvkk
UV light? Injecting disinfectant?

Here’s an idea, Mr. President: more tests. Now. And protective equipment for actual medical professionals. https://t.co/Zv4Mfs2Z4a
The words of a president matter — never more than in times of crisis. A president should seek to calm and heal, provide a steady hand, and a clear path forward.

Instead, this is what we get from Donald Trump: https://t.co/0H5NTAqbY3
Donald Trump will always put his wealthy and well-connected friends first — that should come as no surprise. But to allow the banks to do it on the backs of small business owners in the middle of a global pandemic is a new low — even for him. https://t.co/tG1rVOeZxs
To celebrate the one-year anniversary of our campaign, we're hosting our first #SOULSaturday this weekend. Folks across the nation will be taking time to check-in on neighbors and thank those on the front lines of this fight.

I hope you'll join us: https://t.co/45jVuvcaGf https://t.co/U4WHSkzvSb
As Muslim families across America and around the world celebrate the beginning of Ramadan, @DrBiden and I want to extend our best wishes to all who are observing this holy month. Ramadan Mubarak. https://t.co/mhKD5YSN85
Times of crisis often bring out our best. There are so many stories of good happening around the world amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Take a minute to read a few: https://t.co/sbiSVrBXhW
26 million people unemployed. That's not just a statistic  — every one is a life thrown into uncertainty. Every worker left wondering when they will next see a paycheck is part of this American crisis  —  and Donald Trump isn't doing enough for them. https://t.co/fAzujTeMBI
Unlike our current president, I will always choose science over fiction. https://t.co/56J7o7mDus
Make no mistake: The climate crisis poses an existential threat to our future. But I know the American people have the spirit, power, and ingenuity to meet the challenge head-on. There’s nothing we’ve been unable to accomplish when we do it together.
Workers, like grocery store cashiers, are on the front lines of this crisis risking their lives every day to combat COVID-19 and keep this country running. President Trump is refusing to do his job, but we've got to do ours. Learn more: https://t.co/Cio6Bp8GYq #ShopSmart
Our planet cannot afford four more years of Donald Trump.
We have the power to change the future of our planet — and it starts at the ballot box this November. https://t.co/9COHq8TRZ8
This #EarthDay, let’s recommit to doing everything in our power to combat climate change. That starts with voting Donald Trump out of the White House this November.
@OfficialJLD Stranger things have happened.
Fifty years ago, #EarthDay began as a day of organizing that demonstrated the power of community action. This year, it’s also a reminder of everything that’s on the line if we do not get Donald Trump out of the White House. https://t.co/IkZPE983fO

Throughout my career, I've been committed to the fight against climate change. And on day one as president, I'll get to work taking the drastic action we need to address this crisis. #EarthDay https://t.co/CTbTiwxI4Y
On #EarthDay, we're reminded that there is no more urgent crisis facing this nation, or the world, than the threat posed by climate change. We have to take drastic action before it’s too late — and that’s exactly what I will do as president.

https://t.co/FbsOsz7VzW https://t.co/4KwlWtOibd
Folks, we just launched a special #EarthDay episode of Here's the Deal! Governor @JayInslee joins me for a discussion on COVID-19, climate change, and why he's supporting our campaign.

Listen to the full episode now: https://t.co/gfVHzRcDXo https://t.co/DRJyrZ5njV
The Trump Administration promised 27 million tests by the end of March.

As of now, only 4 million have been completed. It’s unacceptable.

We can’t safely reopen the economy without scaling up testing, and we can’t effectively scale up testing unless Donald Trump does his job.
The Paycheck Protection Program was intended to send help to the small businesses that needed it most, but President Trump adopted an approach to help his high-priced friends. We've got to do better.

Here's what I would do if I were president: https://t.co/NXMrGe56Pg
The right to vote is the most fundamental American right there is. We need to immediately expand vote-by-mail, online voter registration, and early voting to ensure everyone can safely exercise their right to participate in our electoral process. https://t.co/An7O2h1t9M
I know COVID-19 is causing many people to feel anxious about what the future holds or lonely during this time of social distancing — and that's okay, just know that you're not alone. I've asked my friend, Dr. Vivek Murthy, to share a few tips on how to get through this: https://t.co/Hx9TMlF2zP
This Holocaust Remembrance Day, as we remember the millions of Jews who lost their lives at the hands of the Nazi regime, we recommit to ensuring such atrocities never again occur. With anti-Semitism on the rise, all of us must root out intolerance and give hate no safe harbor.
Out of every trial and tribulation, America has always emerged stronger — and we will again. We will not be defeated.
I am honored to have the endorsement of the League of Conservation Voters, a leading environmental advocacy organization. Climate change is an existential threat, and there is no greater challenge and opportunity facing our country and our world. https://t.co/puvpCUScSn
In March alone, this campaign raised $46.7 million, with 70% from online donations. This virus has changed our campaign. But it hasn't changed the unwavering support we've gotten from all of you. Together, we're going to defeat Trump. Help keep us going: https://t.co/GIzEQS0nNj
The President needs to stop blaming others and do his job.

The office of the presidency comes with the ultimate responsibility for the biggest decisions in the world. Every great president throughout our history has met that duty with the leadership it demands. Donald Trump has not. https://t.co/Dn9Gj50Dev
Like many families, we have had to find new ways to stay connected while we're physically apart. We've been video chatting with our grandchildren a lot and decided to record one to share with you all. Take a look: https://t.co/1pGtQGcDhj
On #SOULSaturday, folks will be doing everything from sewing masks and hosting food drives to writing letters to first responders and making calls to check in on neighbors. We are all in this together–and I hope you'll join us by signing up to take action: https://t.co/rRADhp4Usl
In times of crisis, Americans stand as one. We lend a hand to our neighbors and take care of those in need. It's who we are. In that spirit, and to celebrate the one-year anniversary of our campaign, we're hosting S.O.U.L. of the Nation Saturday this weekend.
We have to come together to make Donald Trump a one-term president. Once we do that, we will not only do the hard work of rebuilding this nation — we will transform it and create a better future for all.
On this week’s episode of Here’s the Deal, Senator @AmyKlobuchar joins me for a discussion on how COVID-19 has impacted her family and what drove her to get involved in politics.

.@DrBiden and I are keeping the loved ones of the more than 40,000 people in the U.S. we've lost due to COVID-19 in our prayers. This is a solemn day for our nation, and there will be more hard days ahead. But if we pull together, we will get through this. I promise. https://t.co/WznDkIMRo8
Tonight, @SymoneDSanders and actor @TonyGoldwyn will be hosting a town hall focused on how COVID-19 is impacting workers in the entertainment industry.

Tune in at 7 PM ET to watch: https://t.co/xk0GcS7PGq https://t.co/VmSvAbIaon
To everyone working on the front lines of this crisis, thank you. We truly couldn't get through this without you. https://t.co/vr10U5pca6
No President can promise to prevent future outbreaks. But I can promise you that when I'm President, we will prepare better, respond better, and recover better. We'll listen to the experts and heed their advice. And I will always tell you the truth.
At a time when studies are linking air pollution with COVID-19 mortality rates for the most vulnerable in our society, the Trump Administration is rolling back environmental protections — allowing more poison into our air. https://t.co/047lsdtrQN
As Kierkegaard said, “faith sees best in the dark.” I've always believed that. This pandemic is keeping many communities apart, but we've still got to keep the faith. Jill and I are wishing a Happy Easter to all of the Orthodox Christians celebrating around the world. https://t.co/3gQVAOtdzk
The United States should be standing up for freedom and standing with the people of Hong Kong. Instead, Trump has said he's “standing with Xi Jinping.” That's weak. We need to be strong on values when it comes to China. That's what I'll do as president. https://t.co/O2o66tJFkY
I couldn't be prouder of my friends @LadyGaga and Chris Martin of @Coldplay for organizing the @GlblCtzn One World: #TogetherAtHome broadcast. We are all in this fight together — and if we stand as one, we will defeat COVID-19. https://t.co/TLpW631qfR
On Sunday night, @SymoneDSanders and actor @TonyGoldwyn will be hosting an unemployment town hall on how COVID-19 is impacting entertainment workers.

We will not be defeated. https://t.co/PSbYSIE4CM
Donald Trump left our country unprepared and unprotected for the worst public health and economic crisis in our lifetime — and now we're paying the price. https://t.co/aCxcqQqUqw
Donald Trump says he’s a wartime president — it’s time for him to act like one.
Donald Trump may not like it, but it's his responsibility to step up and lead our nation's testing strategy. Mass testing is key to reopening the economy and returning to some semblance of normalcy. https://t.co/AYmwnMmDB4
Donald Trump continues to do the exact thing we teach our kids not to do: blame others. It’s always somebody else's fault — never his. It’s unbelievable.

We deserve better from our commander in chief. https://t.co/ZNEDGwozyu
Donald Trump is not responsible for COVID-19, but he is responsible for our slow, uncoordinated response.

Experts say that if we had acted two weeks earlier, more lives could have been saved.

Trump failed to take swift action—and we're paying the price. https://t.co/nyq6DpLOid
President Trump is trying to rewrite history when it comes to China and COVID-19 — but the facts don't back him up. Tony Blinken was the Deputy Secretary of State and is one of my top foreign policy advisors. He'll explain. https://t.co/si3vDHnF2r
The uncomfortable truth is that Donald Trump left America exposed and vulnerable to this pandemic. He ignored the warnings of health experts and intelligence agencies and put his trust in China's leaders instead. Now, we're all paying the price.

Let me explain how we got here: https://t.co/esvCaGki9V
I know the American people will beat this. We’re brave and big-hearted. We’ve emerged stronger from every crisis that has tested us as a nation — and we will again.
We’re in the middle of a global pandemic. No one feeling ill should have to choose between earning a paycheck or staying home to recover. We need to provide paid sick leave to everyone who needs it immediately.
It's been a big week: President Obama, Senator Sanders, and Senator Warren all endorsed our campaign — and we need your help to keep this momentum going.

I know times are tough, but if you're able, please chip in today: https://t.co/xMh8n6xLAc
Together, we will defeat Donald Trump. https://t.co/2nF0qVGGaH
Today’s news that more than 22 million people filed unemployment claims over the last month is devastating. It’s clear more needs to be done to help hardworking Americans—so I’m calling for a bigger, bolder approach to keeping people on the job. Read more: https://t.co/r65WXgLKLz
These racist acts have got to stop. No one should be targeted for what they look like, where they or their ancestors come from, or who they are.

COVID-19 is a danger to everyone. We will stop it by coming together—not by targeting people of AAPI heritage. https://t.co/y8vYAQzvsW
Here's the simple truth: This nation has never been defeated when we're together — and we're not going to be defeated now. We will overcome this. https://t.co/7Irkhnbf6I
When we emerge from this crisis, we can't just go back to the way things were. We need to build a better future for all.
To combat COVID-19, we need a decisive public health response to curb its spread and a comprehensive economic response that delivers real relief to Americans.

I've released several plans outlining exactly what I would do if I were president. Take a look: https://t.co/YLHCGF1YM9
When somebody is President of the United States, the responsibility is total. https://t.co/hmhkBymGob
So this week, we’re working through what ours will be. There are a few I know: compassion, kindness, humility, gratitude, and joy. But I want your help. Our supporters have been here from the start—and I want to know: what should be in our campaign’s code? https://t.co/UoRbb41RHD
We won’t defeat this President by being like him. We’ll win by doing the opposite. Where he seeks to divide us, we’ll connect people. Where he shows cruelty, we’ll show compassion. And when he fights, we’ll fight harder. But we can’t do it without you.
Mayor @PeteButtigieg’s campaign had a set of “rules of the road” that helped define the character of his campaign and his supporters. I think it’s a good idea, and one I’d like @TeamJoe to adopt.
In the Biden family, we have a code: My mom used to always tell me, “Joey, no one is better than you. Everyone is your equal, and everyone is equal to you.” I’m working on building one for our campaign, too.
Managing an economic relief and recovery effort is hard, painstaking work. The devil is in the details. It’s all about follow-through.

I've done the work before, and I'll be ready to do it on day one as president. https://t.co/a7oCXZqCL2
We are building the movement that will beat Donald Trump.

COVID-19 is amplifying so many inequities in our society. We have to ensure support gets to those who need it immediately, and then do the necessary work to rip out the structural racism that creates these inequalities. https://t.co/fDUcAdfOHz
We are in a battle for the soul of this nation and I’m proud to have the fiercest of fighters, Senator @EWarren, on my side.

We will overcome this, together. https://t.co/fdOKwA3Iak
President Obama understands, as I do, that we will come through this crisis stronger. And then we’ll not only rebuild this nation — we will transform it. https://t.co/nlilxxpA91
Barack — This endorsement means the world to Jill and me. We’re going to build on the progress we made together, and there’s no one I’d rather have standing by my side. https://t.co/0mAjPZeYmd
Leadership is about never proclaiming power. It’s about collaboration, it’s about coming together in a crisis and finding common ground. It’s about results.  

That’s who I am and the role I aspire to fulfill in guiding this democratic nation to better times.
I am not running for office to be King of America. I respect the Constitution. I’ve read the Constitution. I’ve sworn an oath to it many times. I respect the great job so many of this country’s governors — Democratic and Republican — are doing under these horrific circumstances. https://t.co/vMtcfD45mG
I want to congratulate @judgekarofsky on her hard-earned victory tonight. In the face of rampant voter suppression and GOP recklessness, the people of Wisconsin showed up and made their choice clear. I know Wisconsin will be a fairer, more just state with Jill on the court. https://t.co/Ch9PXnqekt
I am grateful to have the support of so many Wisconsinites and proud of the courage and commitment folks showed during last week's primary — but it should never have come to that.

No one should ever have to choose between their health and our democracy. https://t.co/D4PpzYkter
It shouldn't take a global pandemic shutting down schools to end school shootings. https://t.co/H9Xwn6Mhkd

We're facing a crisis unlike any we've faced before — and I couldn't be prouder of how the American people are responding. https://t.co/wK1mDPDl9b
To everyone on the front lines of the fight against COVID-19, thank you. We truly couldn't get through this without you.
As we prepare to reopen America, we have to remember what this crisis has taught us: The administration’s failure to plan, to prepare, to honestly assess and communicate the threat to the nation led to catastrophic results. We cannot repeat those mistakes. https://t.co/SkfH3U792L
Folks, we just released a special Sunday episode of Here’s the Deal! @RevDrBarber joined me for a discussion on faith and its intersection with some of the most pressing issues we face as a nation.

We are in the middle of a global pandemic — and people need access to health care now more than ever. Donald Trump should reopen Obamacare enrollment immediately.
This new enemy may be unseen, but we have the tools, the expertise, the will, and the spirit to defeat it. There is nothing the American people can't accomplish if we work together.
We need to help as many working families and small businesses as possible. Workers who have lost their jobs or seen their hours slashed and families who are struggling to pay rent and put food on the table need help immediately. There's no time to waste. https://t.co/XFNZK6m1RV
We are months into this crisis and our heroes on the front lines still don't have the protective equipment they need to stay safe. It's unconscionable.

Donald Trump needs to fully use the power of the Defense Production Act immediately. https://t.co/wudATlE3wr
Now more than ever, we have to choose hope over fear, unity over division, truth over lies, and science over fiction.
President Trump needs to do everything in his power to expand the number of testing sites and surge the number of tests. Mass testing is key to reopening the economy and finding a way out of this crisis. https://t.co/WHprzHoGnm
The American people are strong, tough, brave, and big-hearted. There's nothing we can't do if we do it together.
No one should be forced out of their home in the middle of a global pandemic. We need to freeze rent for people who lose their jobs and place a ban on evictions immediately. https://t.co/0sQYpUHosv
We need a president who demonstrates the leadership to address every aspect of this pandemic  —  including the spate of racist incidents targeting Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders  —  with urgency and seriousness. Donald Trump is not that president. https://t.co/4dvq4uiv17
The folks on the front lines of this crisis are American heroes. https://t.co/ZBwPwiVTL9
La historia de los EE.UU. es la historia de gente común que hace cosas extraordinarias. Sé que unidos, y como una nación, nosotros somos más fuertes que este virus. Sé que superaremos esto y seremos más fuertes por ello, se lo prometo. No pierdan la fe. https://t.co/89o4gSMNWF
The health inequities being exposed by COVID-19 are unconscionable.

We can do better. We have to. https://t.co/2T1hcOas9z
Whether you supported Bernie or any other candidate throughout the primary, know that there is a home for you in our campaign. You're not just welcome — you're needed. And I will do everything I can to earn your vote this November.
America’s story is one of ordinary people doing extraordinary things given half a chance. This virus is tough. But together and as a nation — we're tougher.

I know we’ll get through this and we’ll be stronger for it, I promise you. Keep the faith. https://t.co/dC8JvRWPMC
The stakes in this election have never been higher. We have to come together and beat Donald Trump.
This virus can hit anyone — regardless of race, economic status, or access to power — but it doesn’t impact every community equally. It hits hardest those who are most vulnerable and who have the fewest resources.

We have to do better for all our people. https://t.co/fx76CcIPdU
The devastating unemployment numbers have made one thing even clearer: We need a fourth coronavirus relief package, and we need it fast. We need to take extraordinary steps to protect American families and ensure those laid off are made financially whole. https://t.co/PBOyM1JiUu
This morning's news of another rise in unemployment claims—on top of the millions already filed—is devastating. We have to make sure those affected get the benefits they deserve, but we can't stop there.

I'm announcing two new policies to help Americans get the relief they need: https://t.co/fUlIB2Fra2
I can't believe I have to say this, but we should be expanding the number of testing sites and surging the number of tests — not reducing them. Testing is key to finding a way out of this crisis. https://t.co/jj6ftCxVQt
We have to do more to ease the economic burden on working people. So today, I'm adopting two new policies to help deliver relief. As president, I will:

- Lower Medicare eligibility to age 60
- Forgive student debt for low-income and middle class families https://t.co/wtMnhJdCaR
Let me be clear: No one should have to pay for their coronavirus treatment.
Eleven-year-old Isaac Johnston asked me what else kids should be doing in addition to washing their hands and staying home. My advice was simple:

- Stay a safe distance from friends
- Sneeze into your elbow
- And eat your vegetables https://t.co/ksPS4Xb7Wm
We're seeing the soul of our nation on full display every day in this crisis — and it makes me so proud to be an American. https://t.co/PERwpmeL2X
If we come together, we will defeat Donald Trump. And when we do that, we will not only do the hard work of rebuilding this nation — we will transform it.
This nation has never been defeated when we’re together. And we’re not going to be defeated now.
Join our virtual town hall on unemployment and the issues currently facing working families across the nation. Tune in now: https://t.co/hHG9sgNoka

If you're with us, chip in today: https://t.co/bEBrI6DSqs
In the wake of COVID-19, working families across the country are facing a whole new set of challenges. This afternoon, I'll be hosting a town hall to listen to folks' concerns and discuss what we should be doing to deliver relief.

Together we will defeat Donald Trump. But we will also address the climate crisis. We will make college affordable. And we will make health care available to all.  We will not just rebuild this nation – we’ll transform it. And I’m asking you to join me. https://t.co/vJXlroCdDd
And to Bernie’s supporters: I know that I need to earn your votes. And I know that might take time. But I want you to know that I see you, I hear you, and I understand the urgency of this moment. I hope you'll join us. You're more than welcome: You're needed.
We know how hard this is. You have put the interest of the nation – and the need to defeat Donald Trump – above all else. And for that we’re grateful. But we want you to know: we’ll be reaching out. You’ll be heard by me. As you say: Not me, Us.
To Bernie and Jane, as friends, from Jill and me: You haven’t just run a political campaign; you’ve created a movement. And make no mistake about it, we believe it’s a movement that is as powerful today as it was yesterday. That’s a good thing for our nation and our future.
I know Bernie well. He’s a good man, a great leader, and one of the most powerful voices for change in our country. And it’s hard to sum up his contributions to our politics in one, single tweet. So I won’t try to. https://t.co/Z6OkCDWFNm
As Jewish families across America and around the world prepare to observe the first night of Passover, Jill and I want to say chag sameach, and offer our very best wishes, to all who are celebrating. https://t.co/Qg5Wa9ftyT

We’re starting to see evidence that long-term exposure to air pollution—which disproportionately affects communities of color &amp; low-income communities—is linked to COVID-19 death rates. It's past time we treat pollution like the threat to our health it is. https://t.co/3GD15s3xSy
The weeks ahead will be some of the toughest we’ve ever experienced as a nation. We need to face them with the same spirit and resolve that have guided us through previous crises. Because out of every trial and tribulation, America has always emerged stronger — and we will again.
Folks, I know these are tough times, but this crisis has made it clearer than ever how much elections matter — and what a difference it makes who is in the White House. If you can, please chip in to fuel our campaign. I would really appreciate it.

@blackenterprise Jill and I send our heartfelt condolences to the entire Graves family. As the founder of Black Enterprise, Earl Graves Sr. was a trailblazer in his own right, a leader in the American business community, and paved the way for many Black entrepreneurs to realize their dreams.
On #WorldHealthDay, we thank the tireless health care workers fighting COVID-19, and we see clearly why protecting the health of Americans requires U.S. global leadership—to coordinate an international response, strengthen health systems everywhere, and prevent the next pandemic.
Secretary Modly's resignation is appropriate and called for. His disparaging remarks were far beneath the dignity of the office he held. Our sailors, our nation, and Captain Crozier deserve better. https://t.co/cYW1qGhqqH

Congressman John Lewis is a moral giant who has spent his entire life pushing our nation to live up to our highest ideals. I'm honored to call him a friend — and grateful to have him by my side in this battle for the soul of our nation. https://t.co/kqwe6CGre1
We're going to get through this. Together. https://t.co/Te1Ep3RG2y
For months, I called on President Trump to step up and take the action necessary to combat COVID-19.

But week after week, he downplayed the threat it posed, misled the American people, and failed to act.

Take a look: https://t.co/IkkkdeRS8V
Judy, from itsJudysLife, asked an important question during our Family Town Hall on COVID-19: What extra precautions should expectant mothers be taking at this time?

Listen to what former U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy had to say: https://t.co/Z1el7lgoyJ
We need a president who actually listens to the experts and heeds their advice. https://t.co/J7VA462Aff
Mr. President, I hope we can gather in Milwaukee, but that is going to depend on you stepping up and doing what needs to be done to handle this pandemic. I have laid out how you can do that: https://t.co/YLHCGEKnUB. Happy to discuss anytime. https://t.co/ePQuQKkeZV
Folks, our second episode of Here’s the Deal is live! This week, @GovWhitmer joins me for a discussion on COVID-19, President Trump’s personal attacks, and the importance of bipartisanship to deliver results.

Listen at https://t.co/t11Fa0CorE or wherever you get your podcasts.
It is close to criminal the way they’re dealing with Captain Crozier. He spoke up to protect his sailors — he should have a commendation, not be fired. https://t.co/ZnadEsljxX
During our Family Town Hall on COVID-19, I was asked what we can do to prevent this from happening again. Here’s where I'd start: https://t.co/A4M8u9W2SR
During these uncertain times, getting the right information out there is so important.

Myself and @DrBiden had the opportunity to host a conversation about COVID-19 with 3 family vloggers: ItsJudysLife, J House Vlogs and The Curly Coopers. Tune in now: https://t.co/xk0GcS7PGq
These health care workers — and all those on the front lines of this fight — are American heroes. https://t.co/UCATe5J23m
Every day that Donald Trump refuses to use the full power of the Defense Production Act further threatens American lives.
We all want to protect our families — the first step is arming ourselves with the facts.
 
@DrBiden and I hosted a town hall on COVID-19 with three family YouTubers: ItsJudysLife, J House Vlogs and The Curly Coopers. Tune in tonight at 7PM EDT: https://t.co/xk0GcSpr50 https://t.co/gIEPo2PjuO
We are at war with this virus — and the health care workers on the front lines are our soldiers. It is unacceptable that they don’t have the lifesaving masks, gowns, and protective gear they need. https://t.co/10Z6G7Rb2h
Out of every crisis, America has always emerged stronger — and we will again. We will not be defeated. https://t.co/HLR9WBZBhR
Donald Trump needs to reopen Obamacare enrollment immediately. This is no time to put pettiness and ideology above helping those who are in the greatest need.

Lives are at stake. https://t.co/QbyOXboFbr
Jill and I had the pleasure of hosting a town hall with family vloggers ItsJudysLife, The Curly Coopers, and JHouse Vlogs where we answered their questions about the COVID-19 outbreak.

Tune in to the premiere on Sunday at 7PM ET: https://t.co/xk0GcS7PGq https://t.co/9fqyYsGwMJ
Donald Trump is not responsible for the coronavirus, but he is responsible for failing to prepare our nation to respond to it.
We owe so much to those working around the clock to keep our country running during this crisis. The least we can do is provide the pay, benefits, and protections they need and deserve. https://t.co/XCTKfHv9wN
We need a Supply Commander to step up and take charge and get the doctors, nurses, health care workers, first responders, firefighters, and cops the equipment they need to protect themselves and save lives. https://t.co/3OgY1cRGlK
In January, while Donald Trump was downplaying COVID-19, I wrote an op-ed calling for immediate action to combat the growing threat.

In it, I also said Trump was the worst possible leader to deal with a public health crisis.

I stand by that statement. https://t.co/PH4vF5taDa
Throughout the campaign, I’ve talked a lot about the soul of our nation — we’re seeing that soul on full display. There’s so much good happening — people reaching out to one another, neighbors helping neighbors, caring for those in need. It makes me so proud to be an American. https://t.co/aVOCC4vBWb
My friend, @GabbyGiffords, knows what it takes to persevere in the face of uncertainty. Take a few minutes to read these powerful words from her on how we can get through this — together. https://t.co/Kl0OrjB3UG
This is a headline every American should see: “Trump administration ended pandemic early-warning program to detect coronaviruses”

Donald Trump’s shortsighted actions left our nation ill-prepared to deal with this outbreak. https://t.co/P9zT0a3mNg
Those are the kinds of questions Trump will be responsible for. He doesn’t have a great record when it comes to delivering on promises, but I hope this time is different.
 
Being president is about taking responsibility. The blame game won’t cut it. Too many lives are at stake.
The CARES Act provides money to help working people—how do we make sure it gets to them as quickly as possible?
 
There’s money for major corporations—how do we make sure that there is rigorous oversight to ensure it is used to help workers and not enrich top executives?
I’ve done this work before. It’s hard, painstaking work.
 
I was in charge of administering the $800 billion Recovery Act — so I understand that the devil is in the details. It’s about follow-through.
I’ve put together a checklist for making the economic relief and recovery effort work for families, workers, and small businesses. I encourage President Trump to adopt any and all of the ideas. https://t.co/P5gq7h2rtE
Families across the country are impacted by COVID-19—and it can be especially difficult to explain to children. 

Jill and I spoke with ItsJudysLife, JHouseVlogs and The Curly Coopers to answer their questions about the crisis. Tune in on Sunday at 7PM ET: https://t.co/xk0GcS7PGq https://t.co/TUQnhOroTU
Captain Crozier was faithful to his duty—both to his sailors and his country. Navy leadership sent a chilling message about speaking truth to power. The poor judgment here belongs to the Trump Admin, not a courageous officer trying to protect his sailors. https://t.co/AkGFdlYjwt
This is another clear warning sign that more needs to be done to keep as many people on payroll as possible. Fast, bold action to bolster American workers now will save more pain later. Congress must get to work immediately on the next package. We can't afford to waste time. https://t.co/MGOztrldFE
Now more than ever, we need to choose hope over fear. We will beat COVID-19. We will overcome this. Together.
Wisconsin — you have until 5 PM CT tonight to request your mail-in absentee ballot ahead of next week’s primary. Head to https://t.co/hkOfDswg34 to request yours today. https://t.co/6Ldcy3QBT6
The evidence is clear: Donald Trump ignored the warnings. He failed to act. And now Americans are paying the price. https://t.co/1qROBGtsSs
Real courage is confronting something that you're afraid to do and doing it anyway. That’s what people across this country are doing every single day in the face of this crisis. They are American heroes. https://t.co/KQQiU9P8xz
In order for our government to work for all Americans, it's important it be representative of all Americans. With openly LGBTQ individuals only making up .17% of elected officials, we have work to do.

This National #OutToWin Day, I'm asking: Will you run? https://t.co/QvM6IINN4T
I'm about to roll out my plan to make the economic recovery work. Tune in now: https://t.co/fLTDvwK1wf
My heart goes out to the millions of Americans who filed unemployment claims in recent weeks, and the millions more who worry what next week holds for them.

Donald Trump needs to take action to ensure Americans receive the economic relief they need as soon as possible. https://t.co/SprkkQzbTo
I know many folks are feeling anxious and worried. I just want you to know that you're not alone. Americans in every corner of the country are feeling the same exact way you are. We may be physically apart, but we are all in this together — and we will overcome this. I promise.
Our health care workers on the front lines of this fight still don’t have the masks, gowns, and other protective equipment they need. It’s unacceptable.

Add your name to demand Donald Trump use his full authority to deliver these lifesaving supplies: https://t.co/bnHqHEIp1T
The economic damage from this public health crisis is both rising and deepening at an alarming rate. It is putting working families and the American middle class through unimaginable financial pain — and they need to be made whole as fast as possible. https://t.co/QNuB29JcGy
It's now April, and:

- States still don't have enough tests
- Hospitals still don't have enough ventilators
- Health care workers still don't have enough masks

Donald Trump needs to use all available authorities immediately to solve these shortages.
At a time when Americans might need health care the most, the Trump Administration is preventing people who need insurance from getting it. Their cruelty truly knows no bounds. https://t.co/PelIrNxBNQ
Amigos, ¡es el Día del Censo! Solo toma unos minutos completar el Censo, pero ayudará a determinar el futuro de su comunidad para la próxima década. Visite https://t.co/fcbpzx0tJp para que lo cuenten hoy.

Folks, it’s Census Day! The Census only takes a few minutes to complete but will help determine the future of your community for the next decade. Head to https://t.co/fcbpzx0tJp to get counted today.
It is a national disgrace that our health care workers still don't have the protective equipment they need.
Thank you to the governors who are meeting this moment with decisive action, a steady hand, and compassionate leadership. Thank you for stepping up when President Trump has not.
The words of a president matter. https://t.co/OteNK4CWbU
We’re in the middle of a global pandemic, and the Trump Administration is preventing people from getting health care.

I can’t believe this needs to be said, but President Trump needs to reopen Obamacare enrollment, and he needs to do it now. Lives are at stake. https://t.co/84LANkB4AL
Hoy, al honrar la vida y el legado del activista César Chávez, también agradecemos a los más de 2 millones de trabajadores agrícolas que están en primera línea, trabajando para mantener a los estadounidenses alimentados y sanos durante esta pandemia. https://t.co/MNl59g81OV
Today as we honor the life and legacy of civil rights and labor movement activist, César Chávez, we also thank the more than 2 million farmworkers who are on the frontlines, working to keep Americans fed and healthy during this pandemic. https://t.co/MNl59g81OV
Tonight marks our biggest public end-of-quarter deadline of the campaign so far. I know times are tough, but what’s at stake in this election has never been clearer. If you could chip in to help us reach our goal, I would really appreciate it: https://t.co/qRzUR2DdVI
It's 2020 — it’s unacceptable that women still don’t get equal pay for equal work. Let’s close the gender pay gap and end #EqualPayDay once and for all. https://t.co/GH6rASk0wH

Today and every day, @DrBiden and I are proud to stand with the trans community. We see you, we support you, and we will continue to do everything we can to ensure you are affirmed and accepted just as you are. #TransDayOfVisibility
I'm confident that the American people will meet this moment. There’s never been a challenge we've been unable to overcome if we do it together.
We have to place a temporary ban on evictions nationwide. No one should be forced out of their home in the middle of a pandemic.
In order to combat COVID-19, we need both a decisive public health response and a decisive economic response. I’ve laid out exactly what I would do if I were president during this crisis, take a look: https://t.co/Q58OQW6tQO
Our health care workers are putting their lives on the line every day, and our president is accusing them of stealing lifesaving supplies. It's time for Donald Trump to do his job, so our heroes are able to do theirs. Lives are at stake. https://t.co/qiwRjrVUYz
This is unconscionable. Americans are already afraid of the impact the deadly COVID-19 pandemic is having on their lives — they don't need the added stress of losing their health insurance. Drop the lawsuit. https://t.co/VyN90rluy9
I know these are confusing and scary times, so for the first episode of our new podcast I sat down with Ron Klain, former White House Ebola Response Coordinator, to help provide some clarity around COVID-19.

Listen at https://t.co/gfVHzRcDXo or wherever you get your podcasts. https://t.co/bCd1houIqo
The medical professionals on the front lines of this crisis are American heroes — risking their lives in order to save others. We owe them more than we could ever repay, but we can start by ensuring they have the protective equipment they need to stay safe. #NationalDoctorsDay
President Trump should be using the Defense Production Act to get our first responders and health care providers the masks, gowns, and protective equipment they need. This is a matter of life and death. https://t.co/i4jNeL7yoc
The American people are generous, decent, good, and fair. In times of crisis, we come together as one. We look out for our neighbors and lend a hand to those in need. We will get through this, together. I promise.
Not a joke, folks, we just launched our new podcast. It’s called Here's the Deal. For our first episode, I sat down with Ron Klain, former White House Ebola Response Coordinator, for a discussion on COVID-19.

Listen at https://t.co/t11Fa0TZjc or wherever you get your podcasts.
I am issuing this challenge to the President: in the next 48 hours, direct the production and distribution of respirator masks, gloves, protective face shields and gowns to fill every supply request made by a governor to the federal government. 

Lives are at stake.
We will overcome this — together.
As president, I will always choose hope over fear, unity over division, truth over lies, and science over fiction.
It's hard to read this story and not conclude one thing: The Trump Administration failed the American people. https://t.co/I3LOMEvLMf
Instacart needs to step up and give their workers the protections and pay they need and deserve. Now. https://t.co/dYkoW0H227
Dreamers are Americans. We should never endanger or throw into question their ability to contribute to our nation, but to do so in a moment of national crisis is beyond misguided. https://t.co/6n7kQbw6QH
The folks working to keep our country running are true heroes — and we need to ensure they have the protections, accommodations, and benefits they need and deserve. We couldn't get through this without them. https://t.co/eErp14BkuK
Donald Trump’s ego will cost lives. https://t.co/JNcGny13KO
Losing a loved one is incredibly difficult, but it’s even harder when you’re not able to be with them in their final moments — and that’s what’s happening around the country because of the coronavirus. It’s heartbreaking, and I’m keeping everyone affected in my prayers. https://t.co/vAISTRxi5O
The Administration promised millions of tests by mid-March. But it's not happening fast enough. Where are the tests, Mr. President? https://t.co/pI8WBL7oE7
Mr. President, this isn’t about you, it’s about the health of the American people. Stop making everything personal.

You are the president of all 50 states — not just the ones that voted for you or that have governors who “treat you right.” It’s time you acted like it. https://t.co/iMoBKklscY
Let me be clear: No one should have to pay for coronavirus testing or treatment.
Last night, the great Rev. Joseph E. Lowery passed away, leaving an indelible mark on our country's history towards progress. He never once wavered in his spirit and in the resolve to end injustice — wherever he saw it. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family. https://t.co/FPEAyxwTxm
I just wrapped up tonight’s CNN town hall, where we discussed COVID-19 and how we move forward. I know times are tough, but the stakes in this election have never been higher. If you could chip in a few dollars I would really appreciate it. https://t.co/1PoT5yD9CO
You can't deal with the economic crisis until you deal with the public health crisis. It's a false choice. https://t.co/8y1UMD4fMT
In response to the economic impact of COVID-19, we need to provide immediate relief to those who are drowning in student debt. https://t.co/kyZstGHHCG
Join me and the hardworking folks on the frontlines of the COVID-19 outbreak for a virtual round table. Tune in now: https://t.co/SKRTT621IO
This afternoon, I’ll be sitting down for a conversation with nurses, firefighters, and emergency medical technicians on the front lines of the fight against COVID-19. Tune in at 4:15 ET to join us: https://t.co/xk0GcSpr50
Patients need ventilators.

Nurses need equipment.

And Donald Trump is attacking people who dare to do something about it. 

I thank God every day for people like @GovWhitmer, who are doing the work he won’t. https://t.co/vGruGrMVL8
The coronavirus is not Donald Trump's fault, but his inept response is.

He ignored the warnings for months, downplayed the threat it posed, and failed to take the action needed to combat the outbreak.

It's one of the greatest failures of presidential leadership in our history.
It’s never a matter of if another pandemic will happen, it’s just a matter of when — and it’s the president’s job to ensure we’re ready.

Donald Trump's careless, shortsighted actions left our nation ill-prepared and now Americans are paying the price. https://t.co/45GVHtxUHA
The relief bill passed by Congress was a good start, but now we need to:

- Forgive at least $10,000 of student loan debt per person
- Provide emergency paid sick leave to everyone who needs it
- Ensure no one has to pay for COVID-19 treatment or an eventual vaccine
The American people are incredible. Across the country, folks are pulling together, helping one another, and doing what needs to be done to stop the spread. I'm so darn proud to be an American. https://t.co/bCyYCFBAML
President Trump is not responsible for the coronavirus, but he bears full responsibility for the slow and uncoordinated response. The harsh reality is that at least 3 million people now don’t have jobs because he didn’t do his job when it mattered. https://t.co/xlLlQCHn3c
Thank you to the first responders, health care providers, grocery and retail workers, and everyone on the front lines of this fight. Your hard work is what makes America run every single day — but especially in times of crisis. We truly couldn't get through this without you. https://t.co/kr8Q6Me77H
The Trump Administration misled the American people. https://t.co/rZehf87YUj
We've gotta act now to keep the doors open for small businesses on Main Street.

It's simple: The government provides the guarantees; the banks have to move the loans out fast.

If they won't, we need a financial version of the Defense Production Act to make it happen. https://t.co/k4ePem9xLX
If I were President, here's what I would do right now:

- Use all available authorities to turn the tide on this epidemic
- Launch a task force to ensure money rapidly gets to people who need it
- Bring leaders of Congress together to build the next deal https://t.co/F14kf8MRUF
Live from our homes to yours. Looking forward to tonight, @JimmyKimmel. https://t.co/C7sRuiwDvS
Across the country, ordinary people are stepping up and doing extraordinary things — folks like Isaac and Stephanie, who are creating supplies for their local hospitals. Stories like this one make me so proud to be an American. We will overcome this challenge — together. https://t.co/hazgIbUHe4
The Senate passed a major economic relief package late last night. It's a very important step, but the key is how it will be executed. If I were President, here's how I'd make it work: https://t.co/RmcOh0rRPL
If the administration had reacted to the ventilator shortage in February, a private sector effort starting now might have made lifesaving equipment in mid- to late April. Now it is unlikely to be before June.

Donald Trump's inaction will cost lives. https://t.co/83kiIngP6o
In times of crisis, American presidents have always stepped up to meet the moment. But all we've gotten from Donald Trump are lies, excuses, and scapegoats.

Trump has failed our country at a time when we need him most. https://t.co/d2vxUHGiH0
Alright @TeamJoe, join us for Happy Hour. Watch our virtual round table on the issues that matter to young folks: https://t.co/pFhYghw5dt

I'm about to deliver remarks on the impact of the Coronavirus on Young Americans. Tune in to watch live: https://t.co/hOoL3U77Ni
The character of the American people is on full display across the country. In the middle of a crisis, folks are stepping up and doing what they can to help out those in need. The Angeleno Campaign, led by my friend Mayor @EricGarcetti, is a great example of the work being done. https://t.co/eo8GGH6hmG
The American people are rising to meet this moment. We need our president to do the same.
Let me be very clear: No one is expendable. No matter your age, race, gender, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or disability.

No life is worth losing to add one more point to the Dow.
President Trump says no one saw this coming, but that’s just not true. Our own intelligence officials were warning of the coronavirus threat back in January. Trump ignored them, and now we’re paying the price. https://t.co/HCNDWim5Oc
As Americans, we may be physically apart, but we are truly all in this together. When we have stood as one, this nation has never been defeated. And we are not going to be defeated now. https://t.co/T3pFw3DQlj
Let me be clear: Donald Trump knew about the threat the coronavirus posed and failed to act. It’s one of the most unjustifiable failures of presidential leadership in American history. https://t.co/l8BdATZsaL
The stakes in this election couldn’t be higher. Donald Trump is wholly unfit to lead this nation — and that has become even clearer in the last few weeks. We have to vote him out of the White House.
It has been a month since this tweet. https://t.co/19C5oY2YSg
I know we are up to this challenge. The American people are strong, tough, brave, and big-hearted. We can and will overcome this — together.
As this public health crisis rages, with the economy in peril, and with front line workers putting their lives at risk — Trump and Republican Attorneys-General are attempting to strip health insurance away from millions.

No more games. Drop this lawsuit. Save lives. https://t.co/aSgzVzOvlV
In January, Donald Trump claimed the coronavirus was “totally under control.”

In February, he said it would disappear.

Now, he’s saying it “could’ve been stopped pretty easily if we had known.”

Donald Trump knew. He failed to act. And now we’re paying the price.
Across the country, there are incredible stories of folks stepping up to help their neighbors, stories like this one. It's who we are as Americans. Brave and big-hearted. Always willing to lend a hand and care for those in need.

We will overcome this, together. https://t.co/qeNUK1y5fx
Where are the tests?
Where are the masks?
Where are the ventilators?

The American people deserve answers, Mr. President. https://t.co/N2MWYKOzOu
Obamacare was a big deal — and that still holds true a decade later. On its tenth anniversary, we need to double down on our efforts to protect it from Donald Trump's attacks and build on it to ensure every American receives the care they need. https://t.co/aXqHL7LN9f
A $500 billion slush fund for corporations with almost no conditions is unacceptable. We have to ensure the help these companies receive goes to their workers — not their CEOs.

It's time for President Trump and Mitch McConnell to put American families first. https://t.co/SWU2bLhCGj
During a public health crisis, it's unconscionable that Donald Trump and others are continuing a lawsuit designed to strip millions of people of their health insurance. This morning, I called on them to drop the lawsuit and protect Americans' health care. https://t.co/PlfeFNwhG2
What is President Trump waiting for? 

Health care workers don't have enough masks to keep themselves safe.

Hospitals are running low on ventilators that sick Americans could literally need to breathe.

He needs to act now to deliver these essential supplies. Lives depend on it. https://t.co/du94NRJ0YI
I'm about to deliver remarks on the Coronavirus pandemic. Tune in to watch live: https://t.co/HpaqlEb7D1
President Trump and Mitch McConnell are trying to put a corporate bailout ahead of families. It's simply wrong. We need to be focused on helping hardworking Americans, communities, and small businesses — not handing big corporations a blank check. https://t.co/tMBZm26h3y
It’s simple: President Trump and Mitch McConnell are trying to put corporate bailouts ahead of families. And it’s wrong. Hardworking, struggling Americans should come first — not the big corporations looking for a blank check. https://t.co/pxGrnTYebF
President Trump’s dithering on preparing us for this global pandemic and his lies about his response to this dangerous crisis is one of the most unjustifiable failures of presidential leadership in American history. 
https://t.co/pFIoZCJWmH
In this moment of crisis, we should be sending federal resources to those who need it most. It's not just good economics — it's the right thing to do. We have to get this right.
We should also increase monthly Social Security checks by $200/month, as proposed by Senator Wyden and colleagues. Seniors and people with disabilities are uniquely at risk right now.
Additionally, we should forgive a minimum of $10,000/person of federal student loans, as proposed by Senator Warren and colleagues. Young people and other student debt holders bore the brunt of the last crisis. It shouldn't happen again.
On March 6th, Donald Trump claimed: “Anybody that wants a test can get a test.”

That was a flat-out lie then, and it’s still not true today. It’s a disgrace.

We need to ensure everyone who needs a test can get one free of charge. Period.
No bill should pass without immediate, generous relief for workers who are losing jobs and hours, small businesses losing revenue, and communities facing emergency needs.
No bill should pass without conditions on corporations to ensure the help they get goes to their workers, not their CEOs. No blank checks.
It's simple: The White House and @senatemajldr have tried to put corporate bailouts ahead of families. https://t.co/mFsPjmlbHW
We owe a debt of gratitude to the first responders, health care providers, grocery and retail workers, transportation workers, public safety officials, and everyone working around the clock to keep our country running. Thank you, thank you, thank you for all you’re doing.
In times of crisis, a president should calm and heal, lead the way with a steady hand, and provide a beacon of hope for the American people.

Donald Trump is incapable of doing that. https://t.co/0I7ZYNtqCV
We need action, not more empty words from President Trump. It’s time for him to step up and do his job. https://t.co/TBpXhoAg1P
Donald Trump has failed the American people. https://t.co/HsNl9M4h4r
Everyone knows that we're facing a real crisis from the coronavirus. But do you know how we got here and what we need to do next? Ron Klain, former White House Ebola Response Coordinator, breaks it down for us: https://t.co/XRkIw2EzM4
The coronavirus test should be made widely available and free.

The coronavirus vaccine, when ready, should be made widely available and free.

Treatment for coronavirus should be free, too.

We're in a crisis. No one should have to pay for their coronavirus health care costs.
From day one, the goal of our campaign has been to unite the country — and in times of crisis, that goal is more important than ever. If we come together and all do our part, we will overcome this. I promise.
The president has been behind the curve throughout this whole response. He’s talking about yesterday rather than where we need to be tomorrow. The president needs to stop talking and start rallying government action with the urgency and ambition this moment demands.
Now he’s switched to falsely telling us that he’s taking action that he has not taken, and promising results that he’s not delivering. People are scared. They're frightened. And their president is just exacerbating their concerns.
In times of crisis, the American people deserve a president who tells them the truth and takes responsibility. Donald Trump has not been that president. For months, he falsely told us we had nothing to worry about while praising China’s response for managing the coronavirus.
If you have a minute, read these stories of folks coming together and helping out their neighbors. They represent who we are as Americans. In times of crisis, we stand as one. We look out for each other. And that’s how we’ll get through this — together. https://t.co/rardKq7Dtd
The President says no one cares about being tested.

Have you or a loved one had trouble getting tested? https://t.co/WrFcgCtriA
Getting money quickly to families is the right goal, but Senate Republicans are proposing to send significantly lower amounts to low-income families than those with higher incomes. That’s terrible economics &amp; terrible values. We should be targeting help to those who need it most. https://t.co/J0tS9K7c9Y
The lack of coronavirus testing in the U.S. is a national disgrace. https://t.co/kD9cEFtAUR
The least we can do for every grocery and retail worker working around the clock during this crisis is to provide a $15 minimum wage, paid sick leave, and strong workplace protections.
Every CEO in America should be focusing on workers, families, and communities — not executive compensation and share prices.
I am calling on every CEO in America to publicly commit now to not buying back their company's stock over the course of the next year. As workers face the physical and economic consequences of the coronavirus, our corporate leaders cannot cede responsibility for their employees.
.@SenGillibrand has never been afraid to speak without fear, to be brave in the face of injustice, and to empower others to get off the sidelines. I'm thrilled and honored to have her support. https://t.co/3DWCZnsnqB
The words of a president matter, and Donald Trump has used his to downplay COVID-19 and mislead the American people. He is unfit to lead us through this crisis. https://t.co/s7tnaR4G7p
This administration is truly morally bankrupt. https://t.co/aUCRMbLsoS
Every worker on the front lines of the fight against COVID-19 deserves protections and accommodations that keep them and their families safe. I'm glad to see states stepping up to support folks — employers must do the same. https://t.co/QClURuStbV
My prayers go out to all those on the front lines of this crisis. https://t.co/KfNNRsdS7I
Doctors and nurses are making their own makeshift face masks today as they risk their lives to care for others. What other finding do you need to see to convince you to use every power you have to expand our supply of essential equipment, Mr. President?
Yesterday, President Trump said he was invoking the Defense Production Act, then turned around and said he wasn't planning to use it. The President should exercise these powers now. We need more ventilators, protective equipment, and critical supplies. We need action, not words.
.@TulsiGabbard has put her life on the line in service of this country and continues to serve with honor today. I’m grateful to have her support and look forward to working with her to restore honor and decency to the White House.
This is a moment to look out for our neighbors, care for the elderly, and thank the workers on the front lines of this fight. This is a moment to believe in one another.

When we do that, when we see the best in each of us, we’ll lift this nation up and get through this together.
The Obama-Biden Administration set up the White House National Security Council Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense to prepare for future pandemics like COVID-19.

Donald Trump eliminated it — and now we're paying the price.
Our campaign is building the broad coalition we need to win in November. https://t.co/cINCXLJnn0
I give you my word as a Biden: When I'm president, I will lead with science, listen to the experts and heed their advice, and always tell you the truth. https://t.co/tIpjW1ch0L
It is a national disgrace that millions of Americans do not have a single day of paid sick leave.
I know the American people have the capacity to meet this moment. There’s nothing we’ve been unable to accomplish if we do it together.
Stop the xenophobic fear-mongering. Be honest. Take responsibility. Do your job. https://t.co/nQ5aLVrpyb
Much has been made of changes in President Trump's tone in recent days. But with our health care system at risk, a virus spreading, our economy on the brink — and so many lives at stake — it’s time to be less interested in his words and more focused on his actions — or inaction. https://t.co/txoIVUWxTO
In times of crisis, Americans stand as one. Volunteers raise their hands to help. Neighbors look out for neighbors. Businesses take care of their workers. That's who we are.

We can and will meet this challenge — together. https://t.co/xGcTQuc2gB
The next president will have to salvage our reputation, rebuild confidence in our leadership, and mobilize our country and our allies to rapidly meet new challenges — like future pandemics.

We need a leader who will be ready on day one. https://t.co/oizwBqv4Wd
Thank you, Arizona! https://t.co/X8k3ftTFWf

Hope over fear
Unity over division
Truth over lies
Science over fiction
Elections are happening today in Arizona, Florida, and Illinois. I encourage folks to vote by mail or curbside vote if you can. If you vote in person, please wash your hands, don’t touch your face, and stay 6’ from others in line. Learn more: https://t.co/yzZZp4uKFk

Michigan’s response has far outpaced the federal government’s in this crisis. Gov. Whitmer is leading decisively, while you are live-tweeting her appearances on cable news.

We need a president who will do their job and lead this country. https://t.co/WaZhxOdy6x
Thank you, Washington! https://t.co/j4tXRZ4znk

If I win the nomination, my pick for vice president will be a woman. If I win the presidency and have the opportunity, I will name the first black woman ever to the Supreme Court.

A Biden administration will reflect the country we are proud to work for. https://t.co/1rFvE94YIg
We are in a battle for the soul of this nation. Donald Trump threatens everything we stand for, he has:

- Fanned the flames of hate
- Embraced white supremacists
- Separated families at the border
- Threatened our democracy

We have to get him out of the White House.
The coronavirus pandemic is bigger than any one individual. This moment requires all of us to come together — across the country and around the world — to solve this crisis. https://t.co/cbPrIYyjsa
In the wake of the coronavirus, we need a major bailout package that delivers real relief to the American people — not more handouts for giant corporations. https://t.co/Fi8SwNXDU5
Thank you to our health care providers, first responders, grocery and other retail workers, and so many others that are keeping us safe and prepared. This coronavirus pandemic makes it clear that all workers deserve paid sick live, workplace protections and unemployment benefits.
We need a president who will always choose science over fiction.
I know times are tough — but we’re going to get through this. 

We’ve got four big primaries coming up on Tuesday, and our campaign could really use your help. Chip in what you can — I really appreciate it: https://t.co/CoE18Qvo1b https://t.co/lfA6xEp9MI
$90 billion in clean energy funding. A huge reduction in the cost of solar so that we'll never build another coal plant again. 



I did that. Bernie watched. #DemDebate
We're building the campaign that will win this nomination and defeat Donald Trump. If you're with us, please chip in what you can right now to keep the momentum going from tonight's #DemDebate: https://t.co/K7gZczYZlN
The coronavirus pandemic is like a war. And in a war, you do whatever is needed to be done to take care of your people. #DemDebate https://t.co/3U1aarm3Ho
We need a comprehensive response to the coronavirus outbreak. My plan mounts a decisive public health response to curb the spread of this disease and provide treatment to those in need, and a decisive economic response that delivers real relief.

https://t.co/xjxsDn2qCD https://t.co/WQgl2SyM4z
Xenophobia is a disease. #DemDebate
We have to treat climate change like the existential threat it is. As president, I will:

- End subsidies for fossil fuel corporations
- Ban new drilling on federal lands &amp; waters
- Hold oil executives accountable
- Rally the world to raise the commitments of the Paris Agreement
No se puede negar la amenaza existencial del cambio climático, y se está acabando el tiempo para abordarlo. Tenemos que tomar medidas sin precedentes aquí en nuestro país y unir al mundo para hacer frente a esta crisis. 

Lea el plan completo: https://t.co/FbsOsyQkIo
There is no denying the existential threat of climate change — and time is running out to address it. We have to take unprecedented action here at home and rally the world to tackle this crisis head on.
 
Read the full plan: https://t.co/FbsOsyQkIo
Bernie Sanders voted against comprehensive immigration reform — and then went on TV with Lou Dobbs to brag about it.

Immigrants don't take our jobs. They create jobs. And we need a President who believes that to his or her core. #DemDebate https://t.co/lHePLtlTpo
My running mate will be a woman. #DemDebate
If Senator @BernieSanders is the nominee, I will throw my full weight behind his campaign and do everything I can to get him elected. If I am the nominee, I hope he will do the same. Nothing can keep us from being united in the fight to defeat Trump. #DemDebate
Bernie Sanders voted against the Brady background check bill that has kept 3 million firearms out of dangerous hands, not once, not twice, but five times. 

We need a president who will stand up to the @NRA — not one who stood with them against lifesaving gun safety measures.
I took on Paul Ryan's cuts to Medicare and Social Security — to his face. #DemDebate https://t.co/wXp61eg5lf
People need help now. Not four years from now. Not eight years from now. We need a health care plan that can pass. #DemDebate
Senator @BernieSanders' attacks on my record on Social Security are a bunch of malarkey — and @PolitiFact agrees.

We should be focused on going after Donald Trump — not fellow Democrats. #DemDebate https://t.co/PEfKDyUBlW
All those people Bernie says he cares about would have been in deep trouble without the bailout in 2008/2009. It was about saving the economy — and I agree with Bernie, some bank executives should have gone to jail. #DemDebate
People want results, not a revolution. #DemDebate
This is bigger than any one of us. This calls for a national rallying to come together. #DemDebate
This is a crisis. We’re at war with a virus. 

No one should have to pay for coronavirus health care costs. #DemDebate
We need leadership that listens to science.
 
We need leaders who listen to experts and heed their advice.
 
We need American leadership that will rally the world to meet global threats.
 
We need leaders who are honest.
 
That is the responsibility of a president. https://t.co/zcdYiNWRCf
When we have a coronavirus vaccine ready to go, it should be made widely available, free of charge. Period.
This primary has brought out our party's best ideas, and our nation is better for it. If I'm President, I'll continue to bring the best ideas from all corners of the country and fight to make them reality. To see these plans, you can go to my website: https://t.co/8bAii5T2FF
Second: Few people in the country understand how bankruptcy hurts working families more than Elizabeth Warren. Today, I am fully endorsing and adopting her bankruptcy plan, which she called Fixing Our Bankruptcy System to Give People a Second Chance.
First: Bernie has put forward a plan that would make public colleges and universities free for families whose income is below $125,000. It's a good idea, and after consideration, I am proud to add it to my platform.
Across the country, middle and working class families are being squeezed by debt. This is a massive problem, and one that we need all of the best ideas to solve. That's why today, I'm adopting two plans from @BernieSanders and @ewarren to achieve this.
No President can promise to prevent future outbreaks. But I can promise you that when I'm President, we will prepare better, respond better, and recover better. https://t.co/FwxXvfTchd
I'm incredibly grateful for @SpeakerPelosi's leadership every day — but especially in times of crisis. @senatemajldr McConnell should bring back the Senate immediately and pass this important bill to provide relief for American families. https://t.co/eylYXfvFNm
If you're exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 — or might be at risk — absentee or vote by mail options are the best way to make your voice heard, while protecting your neighbors.
The right to vote is the most sacred American right there is. State election officials are working closely with public health officials to hold safe elections. If you are feeling healthy, not showing symptoms, and not at risk of being exposed to COVID-19: please vote on Tuesday.
The coronavirus will not discriminate based on national origin, race, gender, or zip code. It will touch people in positions of power and the most vulnerable in our society.

We need to take action to combat it.

https://t.co/6TVMKr9ygx https://t.co/E7J9olEhIR
The American people have the capacity to meet this moment. We will come together, look out for one another, and harness the ingenuity of our scientists. We can and will meet this challenge—together. https://t.co/xjxsDn2qCD
This crisis requires a national response. Not just from our elected leaders, or public health officials—but from all of us. We must follow the guidance of the @CDCgov and health officials and take appropriate precautions to protect ourselves and, critically, to protect others.
I know many are anxious about the spread of the coronavirus and the threat it poses. And my thoughts are with all those affected, our first responders and health care providers who are putting themselves on the line for others, and everyone making sacrifices to stop the spread.
The White House is no place for on-the-job training — Donald Trump's handling of the coronavirus has made that even more clear. We need a president who is ready to clean up his mess, take responsibility, and lead us forward on day one.
We’re building a campaign powered by the backbone and the base of the Democratic party. A campaign that will defeat Donald Trump and restore the soul of this nation. Join us: https://t.co/gnaFCACYrW
I believe this nation can overcome four years of Donald Trump. But if he’s given eight years in the White House, he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation.

We can’t let that happen. We have to defeat Donald Trump.
At a moment when there is so much fear around the world, we need honest, steady, trusted American leadership.

If I’m elected president, I promise you I'll strive to give the nation that very leadership every day. https://t.co/WjOHDVMb6X
A wall will not stop the coronavirus.

Banning all travel from Europe — or any other part of the world — will not stop it.

This disease could impact every nation and any person on the planet — and we need a plan to combat it.

We need to ensure that every person who needs a coronavirus test can get one — and that the test is free. Period.
Today, I'm releasing my plan to combat the coronavirus. We need:

To everyone who has placed your faith in our campaign thus far, thank you. Your support means the world to me — and I hope I make you proud. I will do everything I can to bring this country together and restore the soul of our nation. https://t.co/prwo6rPAct
I'm grateful that over 125 elected officials and leaders from across the country have endorsed our campaign in the last few days. Now, I'm hoping to get your endorsement.

If you're with me, let me know by adding your name today: https://t.co/gnaFCAUzju https://t.co/FKLhU4xAzV
America was built on the simple idea that we're all created equal—but we've never lived up to it. We've had to fight for it. And we've got to recognize the women who have kept the fires of justice and equality blazing, lighting the way forward for us all. #WomensHistoryMonth
Most Americans don't want the false promise of a revolution — they want results. https://t.co/8ElpMRChuc
We need judges who will respect Roe v. Wade as the law, and we need a Congress that will protect reproductive rights. If I'm president, that leadership will start at the top.
There is an assault on abortion access, and today it has reached the Supreme Court. It's time for our leaders to stand up for women's rights. https://t.co/RFEUC1YLjM
Thank you, Maine! https://t.co/scy7BwVQCy
I have said it many times in this campaign. This nation will be able to overcome four years of Donald Trump. But if this man is reelected, we won’t recognize this country in a few years.

We have to get Trump out of the White House.
.@MikeBloomberg, I can’t thank you enough for your support—and for your tireless work on everything from gun safety reform to climate change. This race is bigger than candidates and bigger than politics. It’s about defeating Donald Trump, and with your help, we’re gonna do it.
I'm Joe Biden and I'm running a campaign that chooses: Hope over fear. Unity over division. Truth over lies.

And to supporters of Pete, Amy, and Beto: last night was your win too — and I’m here to earn your vote. So join us: https://t.co/Wye3ZV9uuQ https://t.co/oDTZsrcMFi

Then this is your campaign.

I taught constitutional law for a long time and here's the deal: No amendment is absolute. There are limits.

Common-sense reforms like background checks and a ban on assault weapons are not a violation of the Second Amendment. Period.
I’m heartbroken at the news of yet another mass shooting in America — and I’m keeping the victims and their loved ones in my prayers. We can’t go on like this any longer as a nation. It’s time we come together and pass common-sense reforms to end this epidemic. https://t.co/7EDvU9OM1v
I'm glad this bill — overdue now for more than a century — has passed.

Congress' failure to act on lynching will forever be a stain on the institution, but living up to the founding principles of our nation means fully coming to terms with the sins of our past. https://t.co/qjdGBvmW2T
In 1994, I took on the @NRA to pass a 10-year ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. The ban saved lives — and Republicans should have never let it expire.

As president, I’ll ban them once again. We will get these weapons of war out of our communities. https://t.co/4ciJQTNxvR
I’m a union guy and always have been. I stand with @UFCW — and as president, I’ll invest in American workers.

We need to protect good American jobs and make sure our economy works for all Americans. https://t.co/1U8mj9DYTQ
The evidence is clear: we can’t wait to take action on climate change. We have to get Donald Trump out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on. The survival of our planet depends on it. https://t.co/dGrNxYizHG

Ban assault weapons.

Enact universal background checks.

Hold gun manufacturers accountable.

End our gun violence epidemic.
In 2005, I voted to allow Americans to hold gun manufacturers accountable for the death and terror they've caused in our country. 

Bernie Sanders voted to let them off the hook. https://t.co/nVMAn5xpbx

Donald Trump is the most corrupt president we’ve ever had — and the American people deserve to know what he’s hiding in his tax returns.

The Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007 was our best shot at fixing our broken immigration system. It had bipartisan support and would have put millions of immigrants on the pathway to citizenship.

Bernie Sanders voted against it. https://t.co/7eU37Jq2RC
Donald Trump and Stephen Miller have raised the standard of cruelty with their inhumane immigration policies. We have to get them out of the White House and ensure our laws reflect our values as a nation of immigrants.
Tomorrow is Caucus Day in Nevada, and we need your help to bring us across the finish line. I know we’ve asked a lot lately, but if you have a few extra minutes, please head to https://t.co/IA2o4NIaRM to talk with caucusgoers about what’s at stake. I'd greatly appreciate it. https://t.co/T33OyMNINP
Vladimir Putin doesn’t want me to be President. He doesn’t want me to be our nominee. If you’re wondering why — it’s because I’m the only person in this field who’s ever gone toe-to-toe with him.
On day one, I will send a bill to Congress providing a roadmap to citizenship for 11 million undocumented immigrants and take action to protect Dreamers. https://t.co/oepf2yWDrR

Experience matters. I’m the only one in this race who has gotten anything big done when it comes to health care. As president, I’ll build on Obamacare to ensure every American receives the quality, affordable care they deserve. https://t.co/hIPeFEpFKW
Grateful to have the support of @latinovictoryus! We can't beat Trump without a broad and diverse coalition that includes and elevates the Latino community. Together, we can win the battle for the soul of our nation. https://t.co/Ulvdm46eTL
America's teachers and school personnel have been forced to make ends meet with too little pay and too few resources to educate our kids. That'll change in my administration.

I’ve sat there and looked in the eyes of parents who lost their kids to gun violence. They want to be able to sue these gun manufacturers. We should let them. https://t.co/thL9G6IPvy
Alex, a law enforcement officer and former Marine from Reno, supports common-sense gun safety reform — just like the majority of America. Here’s why he’s supporting our campaign: https://t.co/BAM6qFjHzs
I'm about to take the stage for tonight's town hall in Las Vegas, Nevada. Tune in to @CNN at 8 PM ET to watch live.
Let me be clear: Mayor Bloomberg should release folks from their non-disclosure agreements. This is about transparency. The American people deserve to know the truth. https://t.co/IdRmpGpumm
The campaign trail is ruff without these two by my side. #LoveYourPetDay https://t.co/opFxSKorox
We have to take on the @NRA and pass real reform to end our gun violence epidemic. That starts with universal background checks, a ban on assault weapons, and holding gun manufacturers accountable.

I've beaten the gun lobby twice — and I'll do it again as president.
We fall into the same pattern every time: a senseless act of violence occurs, politicians offer “thoughts and prayers,” and calls for reform fade away until the next tragedy inevitably occurs.

I’m sick and tired of saying “enough is enough.” We can’t go on like this any longer.
Last night’s debate took place blocks away from the site of the deadliest mass shooting in American history — where a lone gunman took 58 precious lives and injured hundreds of others. Yet there were zero questions about how we end our gun violence epidemic. It was unacceptable.
It’s simple: If you like your private health insurance plan, you should be able to keep it. If you don’t like it, you should be able to choose a new public option.

That’s the choice my administration will give every American — and we’ll do it without raising middle class taxes. https://t.co/pQ8LjknasW
We are in a climate emergency — and every day that Donald Trump remains in the White House further threatens the future of our planet. https://t.co/TAcciLRhrD
It's time to hold gun manufacturers accountable. https://t.co/2qxmd55x9C

Obamacare was and is a big deal. The law:

- Covered 20 million additional Americans
- Protects over 100 million with pre-existing conditions
- Allows young people to stay on their parents’ plans until age 26

Mike Bloomberg calls that “a disgrace.” I call it progress. #DemDebate https://t.co/2uFOJf2kBd
Lots of people on stage talked about health care tonight. I’m the only one who’s gotten anything done. #DemDebate
At the height of Michael Bloomberg’s Stop-and-Frisk program:

- 685,724 people were stopped
- Nearly 80% were black or latino
- Nearly 90% were innocent.

He defended it as recently as this year. Who does he think he’s fooling? #DemDebate https://t.co/vKuRvwVjrw

In important things like flying or the running of a nation, experience makes the difference between success and failure. — Captain Sully Sullenberger

The White House is no place for on-the-job training. We need a president who will be ready on day one. https://t.co/IF17cwXud9
I've taken on the @NRA and beaten them — twice. And I'll do it again as president because everyone should need to pass a background check to buy a gun. https://t.co/Ti2iuhC1Hx
Welcome to the debates, Mike. We have a lot to catch up on about Barack Obama’s record. https://t.co/bMYPLYwnfQ
I know that these past few years have felt like a constant crisis. But this moment is more than a crisis — it’s also an extraordinary opportunity. It’s a chance for us to come back together as a nation to reassert the values that define us as Americans.
Let's be clear: Weapons of war have no place in our communities.

That's why I took on the @NRA and passed a 10-year ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines — and I'll do it again as president. https://t.co/hMQvuuXtNv

President Obama asked me to oversee the Recovery Act, which saved our economy from a depression. I secured the 3 Republicans we needed to vote for it—and ran the program with almost no waste. We didn’t inherit a growing economy—we worked for it. That's what I'll do as President. https://t.co/U8eDUZKywk
We are in a battle for the soul of this nation. Donald Trump: 

- Fans the flames of hate and emboldens white supremacists
- Embraces dictators
- Rips children from their parents' arms
- Spouts racist lies about immigrants

We have to get him out of the White House.

America is full of possibilities. With Donald Trump out of the White House, we can:

- Solve the climate crisis
- Rebuild the middle class
- Make health care a right
- Ensure our government works for all — not just the powerful

Obamacare covered 20 million additional Americans, protects over 100 million people with pre-existing conditions, and allows young people to stay on their parents' plans until age 26.

Under Donald Trump:

- Job growth has slowed
- Manufacturing is worse off
- Income inequality is higher than ever

He is squandering the growing Obama-Biden economy that he inherited — just like he has squandered everything else that he has inherited in his life.
I'm looking forward to seeing @MichaelBennet continue the fight to unify our nation, and beat Donald Trump, in the Senate — Coloradans are lucky to have him in their corner.

We need a president who chooses compassion over cruelty.
It’s not hyperbole to say that we are in a battle for the soul of this nation. Everything that makes us who we are is at stake. We have to get Donald Trump out of the White House and take back this country.

My North Star as president will be rebuilding the middle class. And this time, we're going to bring everyone along regardless of race, gender, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or disability. https://t.co/TyiYGD8D0y
Fred, it must not have been easy to sit there and listen to @realdonaldtrump lie. I’m proud of you for speaking truth to the abuse of power. https://t.co/xrnSAKC8QZ
Mayor Pete likes to call me part of the old failed Washington. Was it a failure when I helped pass Obamacare, the Paris Agreement, the Violence Against Women Act, or the assault weapons ban?

I have a stronger record of passing big, progressive legislation than anyone running.
Last night, President Trump turned his constitutional obligation to inform Congress about the state of our union into an episode of reality television. It was a shameful display. #SOTU
Our administration brought the economy back from the brink of depression, saved the auto industry, and made health care available to millions of families.

Donald Trump gave billionaires a tax break. https://t.co/jBe34MIhtp
Rosa Parks helped ignite a movement that changed the course of history. Let’s carry on her legacy by continuing to push our nation to finally live up to our highest ideals. We can’t rest until we achieve liberty, justice, and equality for all. #RosaParksDay
Caroline has served her country with the utmost distinction both at home and abroad. I'm honored to have her support as we head into New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina. https://t.co/xf153Dhfwm
The fight against cancer is personal for me — like it is for so many people. And it's a fight we must win. With the incredible breakthroughs we've made in recent years — and with so many just over the horizon — I'm confident that we will end cancer as we know it. #WorldCancerDay
.@ATUcomm has been integral to the labor movement and putting our country on a path towards lifting the middle class. We've got a long campaign ahead of us, and I'm thrilled to have the support of my friend John Costa and the hard-working members of ATU with me. https://t.co/VUVwL172Md
Iowa was just the first step. Now, we’re taking this campaign to the rest of the country, and we need your help to do it. I know we’ve asked a lot these last nine months, but there's never been a more crucial time for our campaign. Chip in today: https://t.co/sb6EUIcnyx
Everybody knows who Donald Trump is — it’s time we show them who we are. We choose: 

Hope over fear. 
Science over fiction. 
Unity over division.
Compassion over cruelty. 
Truth over lies.
We need a president who is not only ready to fight but is also ready to heal this country — and that’s exactly what I’ll do as president. There’s nothing we’ve been unable to do when we do it together.
I want to thank our incredible supporters and volunteers in Iowa — and all across the country. Now, it’s onto New Hampshire, Nevada, South Carolina, and beyond! https://t.co/PRwO2rieJ4
Joe's about to take the stage in Des Moines, Iowa. Tune in to watch live: https://t.co/x7RDw4dS17
Iowa — if you’re in line at your caucus location by 7 PM CT, you can caucus! https://t.co/oQ2918WP95
America's character is on the ballot. I don't believe we're the dark, angry nation we see in Donald Trump's tweets — we are so much better than who he thinks we are.
Imagine all the progress we can make in the next four years. With Donald Trump out of the way, we can make affordable health care a right, lead the fight on climate change, and ban assault weapons.

It's all possible. And it starts tonight in Iowa. https://t.co/Zf0Z0q6Sp1
In a few hours, Iowans will gather around the state to set our nation on the path to picking the next president. It’s a big responsibility—and we need everyone on #TeamJoe to show up and make their voices heard. Head to https://t.co/3HaA5wLv2M to confirm your caucus location. https://t.co/lHozVyO6i9
The next president will inherit a country divided — and a world in disarray. There will be no time for on-the-job training.

We need a president who is ready on day one.
The stakes of this election could not be higher. We only have one chance to beat Donald Trump — and we need a nominee who can get the job done. https://t.co/N1yrARZHvc
Caucus Day is here, Iowa! Head to https://t.co/3HaA5wLv2M to confirm your caucus location and plan to show up by 6:30 PM CT. I hope I can count on your support — because together we can beat Donald Trump, unite this country, and win the battle for the soul of this nation. https://t.co/ZM0aET6rW7
It’s caucus day in Iowa, and we need your help to bring us across the finish line. If you have a few extra minutes, head to https://t.co/0OADrrjdo9 to make calls into Iowa. I’d greatly appreciate it. Let’s finish strong. https://t.co/rA1MXti3L2
We choose:

Hope over fear.
Unity over division. 
Truth over lies. 

Our nation’s character is on the ballot, Iowa. Tonight, let’s show them who we really are. https://t.co/GU5pUGcCHE
Today’s the day, Iowa! Confirm your caucus location at https://t.co/3HaA5wLv2M and make a plan to arrive by 6:30 PM CT. https://t.co/vmzNwW1Kro
We can beat Donald Trump.
We can unite this country.
We can restore the soul of this nation.

It all begins tomorrow night in Iowa. https://t.co/Lhj8CSmOZG
When we launched this campaign, I said we were in a battle for the soul of this nation. That battle begins tomorrow night in Iowa—and requires everyone stepping up and making their voice heard. If you’re with me, let me know by committing to caucus today: https://t.co/OFXDjKF5uI
My values are rooted in the American character: tough, resilient, but always full of hope. We need a president who appeals to the best in us and unites this nation — because if we come together, there’s not a single thing we can’t do. https://t.co/t8qkivIL48
This is the final stretch — the Iowa caucuses are just one day away and we need your help to keep the momentum going. Every phone call and every conversation will make a big difference tomorrow night. Head to https://t.co/0OADrrAOfH to make calls into Iowa. Let’s get to work. https://t.co/ZNUfpBg2B8
When I say we need to restore the soul of the nation, I’m not talking about taking us back to an America that never existed—but propelling us forward to a place we’ve never been. Where we finally live up to our highest ideals and everyone gets a full share of the American dream.
I’ve never been more optimistic about the future of America. There’s not a single thing we can’t do if we do it together. https://t.co/u4ZVMv31P0
#TeamJoe has been hard at work making phone calls, knocking doors, and talking with as many folks as possible over the last nine months—but it all comes down to these last few days. We need all hands on deck for this final push. Sign up to volunteer today: https://t.co/mwJBZkb34x https://t.co/OP2UVH0zaD
The Iowa caucus is tomorrow night, it’s time to make your plan! Caucusing is fun and easy — and making a plan only takes a few minutes. Head to https://t.co/OezAqUfIOF to make sure you’re all set. https://t.co/gzExf4lb0v
Trump further diminished the U.S. in the eyes of the world by expanding his travel ban. This new “African Ban,” is designed to make it harder for black and brown people to immigrate to the United States. It’s a disgrace, and we cannot let him succeed. https://t.co/oePD5eSAWY
America was founded on the ideals of equality, equity, and fairness—we've never fully lived up to them, but we've never stopped trying. During #BlackHistoryMonth and all year-round, let's celebrate the rich history and culture that's always been vital to the fabric of America. https://t.co/FNYM1O6CMm
Health care is on the ballot. We need to protect Obamacare from Donald Trump’s relentless attempts to repeal and sabotage it — and build on the law to ensure every American has the peace of mind that comes with quality, affordable care. https://t.co/KlbtBOASNU
We are in the midst of a crisis with the coronavirus. We need to lead the way with science — not Donald Trump’s record of hysteria, xenophobia, and fear-mongering. He is the worst possible person to lead our country through a global health emergency.
From my childhood in Scranton, Pennsylvania, to the halls of the White House — the middle-class values of hard work, respect, and decency have guided my entire life. It's time we brought those values back to the Oval Office. https://t.co/QUXgb4ghzm
The Iowa Caucus is just days away and polls show us in a dead heat. I'm confident that we can compete and that we'll go on to beat Donald Trump—but we need your help to do it.

Every dollar makes a big difference—chip in to bring us across the finish line: https://t.co/LXqZm6avjZ https://t.co/MMU0cI7qLm
America's farmers deserve better than four more years of Donald Trump's empty rhetoric and broken promises. https://t.co/SCUVSM7EQx
We have to restore the soul of this nation, build an inclusive middle class, and unite the country to get big things done. That all starts Monday night in Iowa. If you’re with me, let me know by committing to caucus today: https://t.co/OBEKRgsD0K
Donald Trump's Muslim ban is a direct betrayal of America’s most fundamental freedom: religious freedom. And now he's adding more countries to his list of who's not welcome in America.

It's not who we are — and we'll prove that when we beat Trump this November and end the ban. https://t.co/qdlU5P7MZQ
I've stood up to bullies my entire life, and I'm ready to stand up to the one in the White House. I hope President Trump heard that message loud and clear when he saw this ad air during Fox &amp; Friends this morning. https://t.co/TImcrK1T48
Time and time again, Donald Trump has proven he has no moral rudder. Instead of having respect for others, he insults and demeans. He preys on divisions and stokes hate, instead of healing and uniting.

Trump is everything we aspire not to be as Americans.
.@JohnDelaney ran his campaign with conviction to make our government work for the American people. He will continue to be an important voice in shaping our country for years to come. https://t.co/Dqg0D7s0p7
Let's be clear: If Donald Trump can afford to give giant tax breaks to the super-wealthy, then he can afford to ensure that the most vulnerable in our society receive the health care they need and deserve.

We should be expanding Medicaid — not cutting it. https://t.co/akawD7sV8f
Airline catering workers will feed thousands of people traveling to the Super Bowl, but can’t afford to feed their own families. I stand in solidarity with @unitehere_sofla. @AmericanAir needs to ensure @LSGSkyChefs pay their workers living wages. https://t.co/4nx9nYHoET
The character of a president matters — and we have to make that clear this November. https://t.co/hQobfKY7Fx
Donald Trump is the most erratic and incompetent commander in chief we've ever had. After four years of his self-made chaos, we'll need a president who is ready to clean up the mess on day one. https://t.co/TCOjc3aubF
With just four days until Iowa and one day until our critical end-of-month fundraising deadline — your support has never been more important. Every donation — big or small — goes a long way in this final stretch.

Chip in today to help fuel our campaign: https://t.co/WHzkM56Sas
We can't let Donald Trump define us as a nation — we are so much better than who he thinks we are. Let’s choose to be the more perfect union we've always aspired to be and restore the soul of this nation. https://t.co/zqQnWXRPcN
In four days, Iowans will gather in every corner of the state to set our nation on the path to picking the next president. It's a big responsibility — and we need your help to talk with as many folks as possible about what's at stake. Take action today: https://t.co/0yBebrK3rY
It’s no understatement to say that Donald Trump represents an existential threat to the future of our country. He has repeatedly shown little understanding of — and zero regard for — our laws, our values, or our democracy.

We have to get him out of the White House.
Ending gun violence is on the ballot. We have to take on the powerful gun lobby and pass common-sense measures that will keep our kids safe. I've beaten the @NRA twice — and I'll do it again as president. https://t.co/lrgFPskUrf
The true character of a person is revealed in the Oval Office. We saw it with President Obama. We're seeing it with President Trump — and what we've witnessed from this president over the last three years makes clear that we can't give him another four. https://t.co/SEb3XztnKI
Donald Trump has slammed the door shut in the face of families fleeing persecution and violence. On day one, I will eliminate President Trump’s decision to limit asylum and end the MPP program. #RestoreAsylumNOW https://t.co/3KLjtwEtNE
I've spent my entire life bringing people together to get big, difficult things done. And I intend to do that as your president — unifying our country at the moment we need it most. There’s no limit to what we could do if we come together. https://t.co/DTgRBe7X6H
Equal pay for equal work is common sense — and long overdue. That's why the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act was the first law that the Obama-Biden Administration signed 11 years ago today. We have to continue the fight until we close the gender pay gap once and for all.
We need a president who respects religious freedom. https://t.co/5PrjnXCig5
The decision to allow the Trump Administration to discriminate against immigrants based on wealth is a cruel betrayal of our values. The next four years could have a generational impact on our federal courts — we have to make Donald Trump a one-term president.
I need your help if we're going to restore the soul of this nation. With the Iowa Caucuses just days away, your donation is more important than ever.

Chip in $5 to help fuel our campaign: https://t.co/HlWMIhCyki https://t.co/RfI3EuTCcI
Climate is on the ballot. If we don’t get Donald Trump out of the White House and take action now to address the climate crisis, our planet may never recover. https://t.co/Xu0IrxdYTQ
Donald Trump’s demonstrated failures of judgment and his repeated rejection of science make him the worst possible person to lead our country through a global health challenge. https://t.co/PH4vF5taDa
Imagine all the progress we could make in the next four years. We could make health care a right, lead on climate change, and get assault weapons out of our schools. It could all be a reality — but first, we have to beat Donald Trump. https://t.co/O0FZ2Z1nlx
A peace plan requires two sides to come together. This is a political stunt that could spark unilateral moves to annex territory and set back peace even more. I've spent a lifetime working to advance the security &amp; survival of a Jewish and democratic Israel. This is not the way. https://t.co/H6IhtP1YJd
Iowans, on Feb. 3rd, you have a chance for a twofer. You can ruin Donald Trump's night, and you can ruin Senator Ernst’s, too. https://t.co/NU8hk2TOAf
Let's remember one thing when it comes to impeachment: Donald Trump is on trial because he's afraid to run against me. He knows I’ll beat him this November.
Health care is personal to me. Deeply personal. And I guarantee you that if I'm elected president, I will protect your family's health care as if it were my own family’s. https://t.co/Uj15uqjsCi
Iowa caucus-goers take note. Joni Ernst just spilled the beans. She and Donald Trump are scared to death I’ll be the nominee. On Feb. 3rd, let’s make their day. https://t.co/FKrqfxDW9L
No family in search of a better life should be denied permanent residency because they don't meet Donald Trump's wealth test.

The United States of America should be open and welcome to all — not just the wealthy. https://t.co/ocJREvqcQd
With just one week until the Iowa Caucus, we need your help to bring us across the finish line. Every door knocked, phone call made, or dollar chipped in goes a long way in this homestretch. Head to https://t.co/ie4bECkx0e to get involved. https://t.co/7F1dyHYd4V
On #HolocaustMemorialDay and the 75th anniversary of Auschwitz's liberation, we honor the millions of Jews and other victims whose lives were extinguished by the Nazi regime. Today and every day, we must give hate no safe harbor to ensure such atrocities never again occur.
Selling off public services to private interests at the expense of workers and their communities should be a non-starter. Congratulations to the members of @ATUComm, who went on strike for 84 days to fight for their rights — and won. https://t.co/EJ4JglWcuB
Climate change poses an existential threat to our future — and we are running out of time to address it. We have to get Donald Trump out of the White House and rally the world to meet the urgency of this moment. https://t.co/7kNfqn3EGi
I'm grateful to have the endorsement of the @scj. The battle for the soul of this nation begins in Iowa — and I'm confident that together, we'll make Donald Trump a one-term president and take back this country. https://t.co/xbARVjoFU6
Congrats @MichelleObama on winning a Grammy for telling your story with strength — and with grace. Jill and I are so thrilled for you. Just beat Barack to an EGOT, will ya? https://t.co/EpDsGz4KYj
Jill and I are sending our prayers to the Bryant family and to everyone who lost loved ones in today’s crash. It’s a reminder of how special — and fragile — life is. And it’s a reminder that we’ve got to make every day count.
Make no mistake: Our best days still lie ahead. If we come together and act as one America, there's nothing that we can't accomplish.
The seas are rising. Australia is burning. And in this moment of crisis, our President thinks windmills cause cancer. Solving the climate crisis, starts with beating Donald Trump. And once I do, we'll pass my ambitious climate plan. https://t.co/uClGwalbRW
Firefighters represent the best of America — they put their lives on the line every single day and selflessly rush toward danger to save others.

I'm grateful for the endorsement of @IAFFNewsDesk. There's no group of people I'd rather stand with. https://t.co/KXWOONKaXl
Every American deserves access to safe, clean drinking water. We have to hold polluters accountable and rid our water of unsafe levels of these chemicals for good. https://t.co/j5d6pvPBtb
Happy Lunar New Year to all those celebrating throughout the country. I'm grateful for the contributions that the AAPI community has made to enrich America's diversity. I hope the Year of the Rat brings good fortune, health, and happiness to all.
One of my favorite parts of the campaign trail is meeting folks across the country and hearing their stories. So my team and I are picking one lucky person to sit down with me for a cup of joe.

Chip in today for your chance to win: https://t.co/IYZ70gr2h9 https://t.co/YKzqbOMTvs
Let’s be clear: Transgender equality is the civil rights issue of our time. There is no room for compromise when it comes to basic human rights.
After four years of Betsy DeVos and the Trump Administration, our students and educators will need strong advocates in the White House who will repair the damage they have caused. That's exactly what they'll have with me and @DrBiden. https://t.co/ClKKzccpiU
34 U.S. troops have been diagnosed with traumatic brain injury after Iranian missiles struck their base in Iraq. Donald Trump brought us to the brink of war—then dismissed the injuries as “headaches.”

The idea that the commander in chief would take this lightly is disgusting. https://t.co/Cn8Bb7KLy4
The stakes of this election couldn’t be higher. Every day that Donald Trump sits in the Oval Office, he poses a threat to America and the world. We have to beat him. https://t.co/yaf8S3gEF1
Immigrants have always made our country stronger. Our diversity is, and has always been, our greatest strength. Donald Trump doesn't get that — we need a president who does. https://t.co/XQblLTH61O
The next president will face the enormous task of picking up the pieces left by President Trump. They will have to salvage our reputation, rebuild confidence in our leadership, and mobilize the world to meet new challenges. There will be no time to lose. https://t.co/oizwBqMFNL
My Dad used to say, don't tell me what you value. Show me your budget, and I'll tell you what you value. Your 2020 budget cuts Social Security and Medicaid while protecting giveaways to the wealthiest. You've shown us what you value. https://t.co/7gz2NWCUz8
Great news out of Utah. No child should be subjected to the vile, immoral practice of conversion therapy. We have to ban it at the federal level and make sure every young person is affirmed and accepted just as they are. https://t.co/DVVRikDZ7a
I tell people that when a family experiences tragedy, the most important thing they can do is to turn their grief into purpose. @fred_guttenberg found his purpose — and his courage and determination have helped fuel the fight for gun safety reform. https://t.co/CAEHM0zBeI
U.S. troops hurt in Iran's missile attack are being evaluated for traumatic brain injuries. To Trump, it's just “headaches.” We need a president who respects our service members and honors our sacred duty to care for our wounded warriors. https://t.co/lqzSDWezk7
On the anniversary of a hopeful moment, it's clear Trump's Venezuela policy is a dead end. Millions are suffering with the Maduro regime still in power. https://t.co/dvUGFlTFNO
It’s going to take everyone rolling up their sleeves and doing their part to beat Donald Trump and take back this country. And with just 11 days until Iowa, your help has never been more important. Head to https://t.co/0yBebrK3rY to take action from anywhere in the country.
When we divert public funds to private schools, we undermine the entire public education system. We've got to prioritize investing in our public schools, so every kid in America gets a fair shot. That's why I oppose vouchers. #Espinoza
Empathy matters. I think it's important — not only for leaders — but for everybody to treat people with respect. https://t.co/5HhEOowbBg
An administration that gives trillions in tax cuts to giant corporations and the super-wealthy but cuts food assistance for the most vulnerable in our society is morally bankrupt.
47 years ago today, #RoevWade recognized a woman's constitutional right to choose — but that right is under attack across the country. We must codify Roe into law and fight back against any state laws that violate it.
My administration will not cut Social Security or Medicare benefits. Period. We’ll expand them. Meanwhile, Donald Trump is saying he would consider sacrificing seniors' benefits to protect tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans and big companies. We have to defeat him in November. https://t.co/ChUrheK1ga
Our students and educators deserve better than four more years of Betsy DeVos. https://t.co/ItIVwhBcDC
Every morning I get up, I think to myself, Is Beau proud of me? He’s the one who made me promise to stay engaged — and that promise guides me every day. https://t.co/EYHItOpeML
We have to end Citizens United, but we can't stop there. It's time we eliminate all private dollars from federal elections and return our democracy to the people.
I've been fighting to protect — and expand — Social Security for my whole career. Any suggestion otherwise is just flat-out wrong. https://t.co/KWIIJgFqGk
Our government should work for everyone — not just the powerful or super-wealthy. We need to:

- Eliminate all private dollars from federal elections
- End Citizens United and dark money groups
- Increase transparency and accountability
Make no mistake, Obamacare is on the ballot this November. Coverage for millions of Americans and protections for pre-existing conditions are on the ballot.

We have to protect the progress we've made and show up to the polls to defend the Affordable Care Act. https://t.co/tWaiPrVAKr
Ten years ago, the Supreme Court unleashed an unlimited flood of dark money into our politics with its Citizens United decision—further corrupting our politics &amp; eroding faith in our democracy.

It’s time we end Citizens United. Add your name if you agree: https://t.co/WJ5YRnXGPm
I was reminded this weekend by Pastor McCallum that we've got to bring a sense of community back to this country. That work starts now. https://t.co/TB2R8sg3z7
Social Security is the bedrock of American retirement. And in my administration, we won't just protect it. We'll expand it. https://t.co/Uwilx0GlDQ
Thanks for acknowledging this, Bernie. These kinds of attacks have no place in this primary. Let’s all keep our focus on making Donald Trump a one-term president. https://t.co/tmFbLm98xd
The courage shown today by the lawmakers, staff, and gun safety advocates in Richmond is inspiring. It's long past time the calls for reform are met with concrete action that ends our gun violence epidemic. #IStandWithVirginia today, and every day, until the job is done. https://t.co/ouiZVkgzrT
From my days as a public defender to my time as Vice President — I've spent my entire career fighting against discrimination and championing civil rights. I'm running for president to bring that fight to the Oval Office and give everyone a full share of the American dream. https://t.co/y015JDgrti
In times of crisis and division, a president should seek to calm and heal. But time and again, President Trump has chosen to further stoke the flames.

He is poison to the soul of our nation. https://t.co/CreIEMIHkE
Honored to have won Jacquelyn's endorsement. https://t.co/tGpNZjXacu
Donald Trump's poisonous rhetoric and divisive politics have brought America to an inflection point. In this moment, we have an enormous opportunity to take the next great step forward as a nation.

Let's get to work. We can do this, together. https://t.co/4jTqAI3aCj
The big banks didn't need an additional $32 billion in savings, and their shareholders certainly didn't need an extra $21.5 billion in payouts.

It's time we ensure corporations pay their fair share and that our country rewards work — not wealth. https://t.co/eW8qS4yNBf
The 60th anniversary of our alliance with Japan reminds us that close partnership and deep cooperation are among our greatest assets. I understand the value of our alliances; they make us stronger. I would build on this legacy, rather than dismantling it.
I stand with the snow plow drivers who work day in and day out to keep our roads safe, often in dangerous conditions. Every worker in this country deserves the dignity that comes with fair wages and benefits. Stay safe out there, @IBT_320. https://t.co/hVLXy2urWP
Thank you @Captsully for sharing your story. There’s a lot of kids who I bet needed to hear it. 

Being different isn’t a barrier to success. It can give you the strength to save lives in a crash landing — or even run for President. https://t.co/0sYl6VhJyr
Donald Trump continues to embrace corruption at home and abroad. Rather than addressing the root causes pushing people to flee Central America, he has undermined anti-corruption bodies—first in Guatemala and now in Honduras. https://t.co/bJzaXo3XAQ
There used to be a basic bargain in this country—when you worked hard, you shared in the prosperity you helped create. But CEOs and Wall Street continue to put profits over workers. It's wrong.

We have to restore the dignity of work and ensure everyone earns what they deserve.
Together, we're going to beat Donald Trump and take back this country.

It is a moral failing when children are ripped from their parents' arms, locked away in overcrowded detention centers, and denied toothbrushes and soap.

We have to end Donald Trump's cruel policies and build a fair and humane immigration system.
This isn't just about who I am, this is about who we are as a country. We're tough, resilient, but always full of hope. With every fiber in my being, I believe there’s not a single thing we can't do—if we do it together. https://t.co/GfPWX1VTvH

The character of our nation is on the ballot in this election. We are so much better than who Donald Trump thinks we are — and we have to prove that this November. https://t.co/dToLAHQ2Hd
If true, this constitutes an unprecedented attack on our Foreign Service. Amb. Yovanovitch spent her life advancing U.S. interests, only to be defamed by this administration. Our diplomats deserve better. It's inexcusable that Sec. Pompeo won't defend them. https://t.co/R3rCeQEKX9
America has never lived up to our promise of equality for all, but we've never stopped trying. Virginia brought us closer to that highest ideal today by ratifying the long overdue #ERA.

Women's rights should be explicitly in our Constitution—not left to the whims of legislators. https://t.co/F4E4PYEo0f
I'm more optimistic about our future today than I was when I got elected to the Senate as a 29-year-old. If we come together and unite this country, there's not a single thing we can't do. https://t.co/LGNHTgei6W
My thoughts and prayers are with Mustafa Kassem's family at this difficult time. His death, after six years in an Egyptian jail, is an outrage. Americans unjustly detained anywhere in the world deserve our government’s full support and relentless efforts to secure their release. https://t.co/aWpCb3VJHO
This seems like a great reason to rejoin the Paris Agreement, @realDonaldTrump. https://t.co/HHI4KUokcF

Cornell is right — everything is at stake this November. We have to get Donald Trump out of the White House and unite this country. Because if we come together and act as one America, there is nothing that we can't accomplish. https://t.co/RkNCr4M0ag
Historically Black Colleges and Universities have always been the heartbeat of our country’s fight for justice. That’s why I’ll invest $70 billion in HBCUs and Minority-Serving Institutions.

I just got off the debate stage in Iowa, where we're in the homestretch before the caucus. With just 19 days left, every dollar counts.

Chip in if you're ready to take back this country and make Donald Trump a one-term president: https://t.co/dZBws0E8HE https://t.co/DJDvE02g5l
This is the United States of America. There’s not a single thing beyond our capacity, if we do it together. Let’s go do it. #DemDebate
With just 20 days until the Iowa Caucus, we need your help to fuel our campaign. Every donation—big or small—goes a long way in this homestretch.

If you liked what you heard at tonight's #DemDebate, please chip in what you can to keep our momentum going: https://t.co/oHhLJeow4L
Look, I’ve been the object of Donald Trump’s affection now more than anyone else on this stage. I’ve taken all the hits he’s delivered, and I’m only getting stronger in the polls. #DemDebate
Republicans have savaged my only surviving son. They’ve spread lies about me that networks won’t even carry. It doesn’t matter if they go after me.

As President of the United States, I have to be able to not only fight — I have to heal. And that’s what I’ll do if I’m elected.
Child care is personal to me: I was a single parent as a young senator. I commuted home to Delaware every night to tuck my kids into bed. Child care should be affordable for every parent. #DemDebate
Make no mistake, the situation with Iran is a crisis of Donald Trump’s own making. He claimed walking away from the Iran deal would deter Iranian aggression and result in a better deal. He failed on both accounts. https://t.co/S2nsclIN1B
Under the Biden administration, labor and environmental groups will be at the table to negotiate trade agreements. Period. https://t.co/gKXwU2SpVu
Medicare should be able to negotiate prices with drug companies. #DemDebate
I’ve been very clear about what my health care plan would do: Build on Obamacare by giving Americans more choice, reducing health care costs, and making our health care system easier to navigate. #DemDebate
If we don’t write the global rules of the road for trade, cyber, climate change, and so much more, they may be written by China or other nations that don’t share our values. #DemDebate
I wouldn’t meet with Kim Jong Un without pre-conditions. By meeting with him, Donald Trump gave Kim Jong Un what he was looking for: legitimacy. I will work closely with our allies and hold China accountable for its lack of pressure on the Kim regime’s bad behavior. #DemDebate
No president can take our country to war without the informed consent of the American people. #DemDebate
There’s a big difference between sending tens of thousands of American combat troops to the Middle East indefinitely – which I oppose and will end – and using small teams of special forces to support local forces doing the fighting to advance our common security. #DemDebate
No one should shed a tear for Qassem Soleimani. But Trump’s reckless escalation and thoughtless withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal has made America less safe. We need a return to diplomacy and a steady hand at the wheel to navigate an increasingly dangerous world. #DemDebate
When Trump discarded the Iran nuclear deal he promised it would produce a “better” one and curb Iranian aggression—the reverse happened. Iran has restarted its nuclear program and become more provocative. I’ll return to smart, disciplined diplomacy to address the threats we face.
In 2009 President Obama asked me to oversee our effort to bring home our combat troops. I’ll put my record and my judgment up against anyone in terms of who is the right person to be Commander in Chief. #DemDebate
I’m about to step on stage for tonight’s #DemDebate in Iowa. Make sure to follow along here and on @TeamJoe for updates throughout the night, and tune in to @CNN at 9 PM ET to watch live!
So much of what’s tearing this country apart can be fixed if we treat each other with basic dignity and respect once again. That starts with having a president who leads by example. https://t.co/izfs0K7Jk0
Donald Trump has once again sided with corporations over American workers by making it easier for them to get away with wage theft and overtime violations.

It's time we put workers' rights over corporate greed and ensure everyone has the workplace protections they deserve. https://t.co/6SgkalkZCT
We’re in a battle for the soul of our nation — and Donald Trump is poison to our soul. He has:

- Fanned the flames of hatred and bigotry
- Embraced dictators
- Ripped children from their parents' arms
- Degraded our national character

We have to get him out of the White House.
Why are you so obsessed with me, Mr. President? https://t.co/BbAawEvQo6
I'm married to a teacher, I see firsthand how difficult it is. We've got to let educators do their job so our students can succeed - that means paying them the salaries they deserve and giving them the respect that they've earned. https://t.co/iRLj2DPa2o
From day one, Donald Trump has been determined to roll back every environmental protection he could get his hands on.

At a time when the climate crisis is pushing our planet to the brink, we should strengthen protections — not weaken them. https://t.co/RPfnT2Fz9y
The stakes of this election could not be higher. Eight years of Donald Trump will fundamentally alter the character of our nation. We can't let that happen.

We have to do everything in our power to make him a one-term president.
When we said to give us your tired, poor, and huddled masses, we absolutely did not mean unless they are fleeing violence. https://t.co/OeIWRpPC8I
Transit workers are being attacked every day, often while buses are moving, putting bus drivers and riders in harm's way. That's why I strongly support the Transit Worker and Pedestrian Protection Act to protect our workers from harm while doing their job. https://t.co/4nbHsjtKRr
Donald Trump has no strategy when it comes to Iran. No endgame. The only way out of his self-made crisis is through diplomacy — clear-eyed, hard-nosed diplomacy grounded in strategy, that's not about one-off decisions or one-upmanship. https://t.co/yfb8OE98Xu
Come on. Your administration has been arguing in court to repeal protections for people with pre-existing conditions.

You're trying to take health care away from millions of people. The least you could do is be honest about it. https://t.co/T0XxHFgy44
Cory, you campaigned with joy and heart, and instead of just talking about bringing people together, you did it every day. You made our politics better just by running. Grateful to you and looking forward to your continued leadership.
Puerto Rico should not be treated any differently than if this happened anywhere else in America — it's wrong. We should be surging all the help that is needed to fix the damage done by the earthquakes. https://t.co/AIAuQy2Fjs
There’s enormous opportunity once we get rid of Donald Trump. We can:

- Address the climate emergency
- Build a more inclusive middle class
- Build on Obamacare
- Ensure our government works for everyone — not just the powerful
Trump’s reckless policies have needlessly endangered our interests in the Middle East. But none of us should be under any illusions about the Iranian regime, and the Iranian people — like all people everywhere — have the right to peaceful protest. The world should support them.
Gracias por su apoyo, Mayor @EricGarcetti. Estoy orgulloso de caminar junto a los bomberos, los Angelenos, y los Americanos. Y hoy, me siento orgulloso de caminar junto a ti. Vamos. https://t.co/X0WRq7QEnD

Members of Teamsters Local 104 are striking against ASARCO for their unfair labor practices—I called into the picket line to support them. Every company should provide its workers with the pay and benefits they've earned—especially one that pulls in over $1 billion in profits. https://t.co/Pm1EYxodmU
Firefighters represent the best of America — courageous, selfless, and always answering the call to duty. I'm grateful to those who are heading to help our friends in Australia battle devastating wildfires. https://t.co/ncemFZLB6M
Being a nation of immigrants is and has always been one of our greatest strengths. Our diversity has always made us stronger, but Donald Trump doesn’t get that. https://t.co/W8ORewXTYA
Make no mistake: the situation with Iran is a crisis of Donald Trump's own making. He brought us to the brink of war with no plan and no strategy.

He is the most erratic and incompetent commander in chief we've ever had. https://t.co/LkmJvh1FAn
I've released 21 years of my tax returns. Why haven't you released any of yours, Mr. President?

Release your taxes or hush up about corruption. https://t.co/g1C7l4imKW
Donald Trump brought us dangerously close to starting a new war with Iran without any semblance of a plan.

This moment requires a leader who will be ready on day one to pick up the pieces and repair the damage Trump has caused. https://t.co/HDNnbR8tEB
I started the Cancer Moonshot so we could be the generation that finally cures cancer.

You then tried to slash nearly $1 billion for cancer funding.

We're lucky that the cancer rate is down, but we're luckier that Congress stopped you. https://t.co/MY3BtXMLoE
This election is about the soul of America — and a nation that allows our epidemic of school shootings to continue has a troubled soul. We have to beat the @NRA and get weapons of war off our streets. Lives depend on it. https://t.co/WtSljHo3ka
Facebook continues to put their profits over the truth — allowing politicians like Donald Trump to spend an unthinkable amount of money on paid disinformation. Our democracy is worse off for their failure to confront this. https://t.co/sKaAjHsKc7
We are so much better than who Donald Trump thinks we are. We don’t have to give in to his dark, petty, angry vision of America. We can choose to be the more perfect union we have always aspired to be — and restore the soul of this nation. https://t.co/nkD23GxirG
Instead of using his statement today to lay out a coherent strategy on Iran, Donald Trump used it to mislead the country on the Obama-Biden record. He's been President for three years. It's time he stops blaming President Obama for his failures.
I'm thankful no one was hurt in last night's attack. But we're only in this mess because Donald Trump pulled out of the Iran Deal (which even his advisors said was working), turned his back on our allies, and had no strategy for what comes next.
Gabby is one of the strongest people I know. The resilience she has shown is remarkable. I'm inspired by her courage in turning tragedy into purpose and grateful for her relentless determination to make our country a safer place for all. https://t.co/PHlQy6cxYF
3,820 days — that's how long it's been since the federal minimum wage was last raised. It’s unacceptable. Raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour nationwide should be just our starting point for ensuring workers receive the pay they deserve. https://t.co/pL3qZXsCJu
Pope Francis is absolutely right. As a nation, we have a moral obligation to ensure everyone has access to the care they need. Health care is a right for all — not a privilege for the few. https://t.co/c84y4GAMCq
We have to rebuild the middle class. But this time, we have to make sure that people historically left out of the middle class — whether due to race, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or religion — have the chance to be included in our success. https://t.co/YTwf2WYOYd
I’m going to hold off on commenting on the news tonight until we know more, but there is one thing I will say: Jill and I are keeping our troops and Americans overseas in our prayers. We hope you’ll keep them in yours.

On Día de los Reyes, as Christmas comes to a close, we are reminded of the call of the three kings: to give of ourselves without expectation, seek peace no matter how long the journey, and know that a bright future is within reach. Jill and I wish a Happy Three Kings’ Day to all!
Let's be clear: Donald Trump does not have the authority to take us into war with Iran without Congressional approval. A president should never take this nation to war without the informed consent of the American people.
John Deere is laying off yet another round of workers in Iowa because of Donald Trump's reckless trade war. All he's succeeded at is taking jobs away from American workers. It has to stop. https://t.co/bIXYrQ240G

Our Statue of Liberty invites in the tired, the poor, the huddled masses yearning to breathe free. But Donald Trump has slammed the door in the face of families fleeing persecution and violence. Jill traveled to Matamoros to shed light on how these policies hurt asylum seekers. https://t.co/2Bwwl2pEzq
This is a crisis of Donald Trump’s own making. He claimed pulling out of the Iran deal would deter Iranian aggression and result in a better deal. He has failed on both counts.

The prospect of direct conflict with Iran is greater than ever. Does Donald Trump have a strategy for what comes next?

Nothing we have seen from this Administration suggests that they are prepared to deal with the risks we now confront. https://t.co/RF7DD3rcDb

My statement on the killing of Qassem Soleimani. https://t.co/4Q9tlLAYFB
Donald Trump stacked the Supreme Court with justices to try to overturn Roe v. Wade—and now Republicans are seizing the opportunity to restrict a woman's constitutional right to choose.

As we move into the New Year, there's one thing I know: in 2020 we're going to beat Donald Trump and take back this country.
2019 was a year of record violence — it will be a moral failure if we allow 2020 to be the same. We have to elect leaders with the courage to take on the @NRA and pass common-sense gun safety reform. We have to end this epidemic. https://t.co/Qhv4SVzc9X
Next year could give us one of two things: a new administration or four more years of Donald Trump.

We can defeat him, but only with your help. Chip in what you can before our midnight deadline: https://t.co/e9CcZTIZ9s

Our democracy is in trouble. We’re at the breaking point. And we need a president who will rise above the personal attacks and reach out to unite this nation.

If we come together and act as one America, there's nothing we can’t accomplish.
The subpoenas should go to witnesses with testimony to offer to Trump’s shaking down the Ukraine government — they should go to the White House.
But I am just not going to pretend that there is any legal basis for Republican subpoenas for my testimony in the impeachment trial. That is the point I was making yesterday and I reiterate: this impeachment is about Trump’s conduct, not mine.
I want to clarify something I said yesterday. In my 40 years in public life, I have always complied with a lawful order and in my eight years as VP, my office — unlike Donald Trump and Mike Pence — cooperated with legitimate congressional oversight requests.
Our end-of-year fundraising deadline is quickly approaching — and we need your help to reach our goal in order to make the investments in Iowa necessary to win.

This idea is Stephen Miller’s. The responsibility is Trump's. https://t.co/R2Id7tCiVu
When Champ and Major go to the vet, I want them to get the best care, and for their caretakers to be paid a fair wage. @marspetcareUS are standing in the way of unionization efforts at @VCAPetHealth and @bluepearlvet. Vet techs deserve a voice in the workplace.
It has now been nearly 300 days. It’s time for @senatemajldr McConnell to do his job and bring this bill up for a vote. Lives depend on it. https://t.co/rFzGmuMUMf
I’m more optimistic about our future today than I was when I got elected to the Senate as a 29-year-old. If we come together and act as one America, there is nothing that we cannot accomplish.
We had a great night at tonight’s #DemDebate, and I really appreciate your support. Let’s keep this momentum going — if you can, chip in $5 to help fuel our campaign now: https://t.co/17qqwjr0eW https://t.co/hEaa5daSSP
China commits enormous human rights abuses, and denies its citizens access to basic information — all while Trump looks the other way. If I am president, human rights won't be blacked out of the conversation. https://t.co/1019FCsLYt

I just stepped off tonight's #DemDebate stage, where I discussed my bold vision for our future and how I'll deliver real change for American families. It was a great night, but now I need your help – chip in $5 to keep our momentum going: https://t.co/SfGQSd4CM9
The ability to make change will come down to three things:
 
- Who can beat Trump?
- Who can help flip the Senate?
- Who can turn big ideas into change?
 
I am the best candidate on stage to do all three. #DemDebate
The climate emergency presents an enormous opportunity for our nation to take action. We have to get Donald Trump out of the White House and tackle this crisis. #DemDebate https://t.co/1NpOrW2Eo1
Let’s be clear — Medicare for All not only ends private health coverage, it eliminates millions of jobs, and increases taxes on the middle class. #DemDebate https://t.co/PCN0yggK4Y
I have long been a skeptic on Afghanistan. We must learn the lessons of the past 18 years. It is long past time to end America’s longest war and focus on what is achievable: a narrow counterterrorism mission. #DemDebate
I refuse to accept the notion that we can never get to a place where we have cooperation again. If that’s the case, we’re dead as a country. When we can’t convince them, we have to go out and beat them. #DemDebate https://t.co/mQqU7aRc4f
The United States and our partners make up more than half of global GDP. If we stand together, China won’t be able to withstand the pressure. We should be mobilizing our allies to meet this challenge, not driving them away. #DemDebate
America's commitment to Israel’s security must be unwavering. The Obama-Biden administration provided unprecedented levels of assistance, including for Iron Dome. But true peace and security for Israelis &amp; Palestinians requires a two-state solution. Trump has set us back.
If anyone has reason to be angry with the Republicans and not want to cooperate it's me, the way they've attacked me, my son, my family. I have no love. But the fact is we have to be able to get things done and when we can't convince them, we go out and beat them. #DemDebate
We need to restore integrity to the office of the Presidency. And it's time we got that underway. #DemDebate https://t.co/ZZMLhU3CQi
The middle class is getting killed. 40% of farmers in the midwest couldn’t pay their bills last year. We have to make sure the middle class has a shot, and that’s why we must change this Presidency now. #DemDebate https://t.co/790cFmj5Oa
The science is clear: we need action now, and we can't do it alone. As president, I will take unprecedented action at home and abroad to tackle the climate crisis head on. #DemDebate https://t.co/SyVhWMnAaE
My north star as president will be rebuilding the backbone of this country: the middle class. And, I’m going to make sure that this time everyone comes along. #DemDebate
The House carried out its constitutional duty in impeaching Donald Trump. Regardless of the outcome in the Senate, we must stay focused on doing everything we can to ensure he doesn’t get elected to a second term. Join us: https://t.co/gnaFCACYrW

John Dingell was an American patriot and a selfless public servant — and Debbie Dingell has carried his legacy in the House with grace and dignity. This is equally as cruel as it is pathetic, and it is beyond unconscionable that our President would behave this way. https://t.co/6doyTXP4ca
Donald Trump failed to repeal the ACA in Congress. Now he has turned to the courts to sabotage it — and is threatening protections for more than 100 million people with pre-existing conditions in the process. We need to protect Obamacare — and build on it. https://t.co/wFWiCSHfnY
President Trump abused his power, violated his oath of office, and betrayed our nation. This is a solemn moment for our country. But in the United States of America, no one is above the law — not even the President.

Hate didn’t begin with Donald Trump, and it won’t end with him. But this is a defining moment in our nation’s history. A moment where we are once again called to fight against the same forces of hate and intolerance that we've battled throughout history. https://t.co/7uUXqyD1Zs
We should be dedicating America’s brightest minds to solving the gun violence epidemic. This funding for research on the causes and prevention of gun violence is long overdue. https://t.co/Of7ISxdfbf

@brianschatz @CarolynBMaloney It is long past time that every American has 12 weeks of paid leave to address their own health needs or care for any of their loved ones.

Every day that Donald Trump sits in the Oval Office, he proves how morally unfit he is to lead our country. We must make him a one-term president.
.@JohnKerry is a patriot who has dedicated his life to serving our country. I'm lucky to call him a friend and honored to have his endorsement. https://t.co/gU0ACEDu0L
Let’s call this what it is: a right-wing effort to influence our elections and make it harder for folks to vote. We have to fight these partisan attacks on our democracy and ensure everyone can make their voice heard at the ballot box. https://t.co/Wncpg6VcP2
There is no time to waste when it comes to addressing the existential threat of climate change. We need a president who is ready on day one to rally the world to meet the urgency of this crisis. https://t.co/vbNKpTgtRK

What kind of president bullies a teenager? @realDonaldTrump, you could learn a few things from Greta on what it means to be a leader. https://t.co/18Y6uZexMC
Trump’s reckless decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement has put our ability to confront the climate crisis in jeopardy. It proves he doesn’t have any idea of what we’re up against, despite indisputable evidence. And it again confirms that he's incapable of real leadership.
I’ll rejoin the Paris Agreement on day one—and rally the world to push our progress further and faster. It’s time to put an end to Trump’s shameful abdication of leadership. The future of our country and the world our children and grandchildren inherit hangs in the balance.
The first and most important part of my climate change plan: beating Donald Trump. https://t.co/juiL35urWH
We are so much better than who Donald Trump thinks we are — we cannot let him define us as a nation.
We must take urgent action to end Donald Trump’s draconian immigration policies. In my first 100 days, we will:

- End his inhumane asylum policies
- End wasteful efforts to build a wall
- Reverse “Muslim bans”
- Reverse his “public charge” rule
- Protect Dreamers &amp; TPS holders
Trump has bullied our neighbors in Central America and abandoned U.S. leadership in the region.

As president, I'll renew a robust commitment to U.S. leadership and pursue a comprehensive strategy of support for Central America: https://t.co/9CHBJlc3UM
You shouldn’t be forced to give up the health insurance and benefits that you fought for. Period. https://t.co/sqNVioTmDM
@DrBiden Our gun laws make these hate-filled attacks even more deadly. We must pass common-sense reforms to keep guns out of dangerous hands and work to end our gun violence epidemic.
.@DrBiden and I are keeping those affected by this hate-filled attack in our hearts. We cannot be silent in the face of anti-Semitism. We are in a battle for the soul of this nation — and it's up to all of us to stand up to bigotry and to give hate no safe harbor. https://t.co/4I4AKvXFxp
Being a nation of immigrants has always been one of our greatest strengths. Our diversity makes us stronger. Donald Trump doesn't get that — we need a president who does. https://t.co/cQSjBrRF1o
Immigration has always made us stronger—it’s essential to who we are. But Donald Trump has waged an assault on our values as a nation of immigrants.

As president, I'll undo Trump’s damage and put our values back at the heart of our immigration system: https://t.co/29QNatX4Wg
.@GretaThunberg’s passion and courage have inspired millions and sparked a youth-led movement for change in every corner of the globe. This honor is well-deserved and serves as a reminder of the urgent, drastic action we must take to address the climate crisis. https://t.co/LB3nmt1BUV

36,878 — that’s how many Americans have died from gun violence so far this year. We cannot go on like this any longer. We must take action to end our gun violence epidemic.

Today, House Democrats led the way by passing a bill to restore the Voting Rights Act. All but one Republican voted against it. Shameful. Strengthening our democracy should not be a partisan issue. #HR4 #RestoreTheVote
The Voting Rights Act used to be one of our best tools to fight state laws designed to suppress the vote — particularly the votes of people of color. Then it was gutted by the Supreme Court, and Congressional Republicans have refused a legislative fix.
I’m so proud and so humbled to have @JohnKerry's support. He is an American hero, statesman, visionary, and friend. His endorsement and partnership mean the world to me. https://t.co/RShmQw3F2n

.@DrBiden and I send our prayers to those affected by today's tragic shooting at Naval Air Station Pensacola. We're grateful for the brave first responders who rushed to the scene and selflessly risked their lives to save others.
A job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about dignity. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say everything is going to be okay—and mean it. Too many people today can’t do that.

We have to rebuild an inclusive middle class and restore the dignity of work.

.@GovernorBullock and I have always agreed on a central tenet of his campaign: every American deserves a fair shot. He has served Montana well and will continue to do so with fairness and strength. Thank you, Governor.
Meet Richard. Find out why he, like millions of Americans, supports protecting and expanding Obamacare. https://t.co/Yp6G1ci0ag
American leadership has served as the backbone of NATO since its founding 70 years ago — until President Trump. His abdication of America’s traditional leadership role could not come at a more critical moment for the alliance. https://t.co/xDIRFzjyBe
64 years ago today, Rosa Parks' courageous act forever changed our country and the course of history. We must continue to follow her brave example and speak out against injustice, wherever it is found.
We’re officially on the road for our eight-day #NoMalarkey Tour across Iowa! https://t.co/cGSblBnHoZ

Eight years of Donald Trump will fundamentally alter the character of our nation. We cannot let that happen.

We must make him a one-term president.
Fired up and ready to go for the #NoMalarkey barnstorm! https://t.co/4lpU7waqzh
Jill and I would like to extend our greetings to those celebrating the Hmong New Year. Wishing you joyous, colorful celebrations throughout the country filled with music, quality time with family, and all blessings for new beginnings — Nyob Zoo Xyoo Tshiab!
26 years ago, I fought to get the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act passed — and established the background check system that has kept guns out of the hands of so many dangerous individuals.

I’ve taken on the @NRA and beaten them — twice. As president, I’ll do it again.
Today, and every day, I encourage you to shop locally and support the folks in your community working hard every day. #SmallBusinessSaturday https://t.co/aAvftiI1W7

As president, I will stand up to the abuse of power by polluters who disproportionately harm communities of color and low-income communities. https://t.co/4zGTt7wkFS
It's time we start rewarding work, not just wealth. As president, I'll reverse Trump's tax cuts for the super-wealthy and build a stronger, more inclusive middle class.

Jill and I greatly admire the work of @NobelPrize laureate @DenisMukwege and @PanziHospital for raising awareness and caring for survivors of sexual violence in eastern Congo. We must end impunity for perpetrators. #16Days
Thank you @JeanneShaheen for leading the fight to ensure that women veterans have the resources they need to be safe from violence. One of my top priorities as president will be to renew and expand VAWA — including passing this bill. https://t.co/51LdnkcUn6
We have so much to be thankful for — today and every day. Happy Thanksgiving to those serving overseas who can’t be home with family, and to Americans in every corner of the country. We hope your day is filled with family and friends, laughter, and gratitude. https://t.co/Sp0NGh1aaC

Many of those seeking asylum on our southern border are fleeing horrific forms of gender-based violence. As president, I will restore asylum status for domestic violence survivors &amp; spearhead an initiative to end violence against women and girls in Central America. #16Days
Obamacare provided protections to over 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions. It was a huge step forward, but we can’t stop there. I’ll protect and build on Obamacare to ensure every American has the peace of mind that comes with quality, affordable health care.
We cannot let President Trump define who we are as a nation. America is hopeful and inclusive — we give hate no safe harbor and leave no one behind. We are everything that Donald Trump is not. https://t.co/98nSHN3hSJ
We’ve got to build a stronger, more inclusive middle class. That starts by strengthening public and private sector unions — because all workers should be empowered to bargain for what they deserve.

The American people are still waiting to see your tax returns, @realDonaldTrump. What are you hiding?
We must get Donald Trump out of the White House. Once we do, we can:

- Combat climate change
- Rebuild a more inclusive middle class
- Protect and build on Obamacare
- Ensure our government works for all Americans — not just the powerful
One of my favorite parts of being on the campaign trail is meeting folks across the country and hearing their stories. That's why I want to sit down and have dinner with you—and yes, we can have ice cream for dessert!

Our students and educators cannot afford four more years of Donald Trump and Betsy DeVos.
It’s time we remember who we are as Americans: we treat each other with dignity, we leave nobody behind, and we give hate no safe harbor.
Weapons of war have no place in our communities.
 
I’ve successfully taken on the @NRA to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines before, and I’ll do it again in the White House. https://t.co/AbTUKdY7Bv
I’m running for president to build an inclusive middle class where everyone comes along — regardless of race, gender, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or disability.
Four more years of Donald Trump will fundamentally alter the character of this nation. We cannot stand by and watch that happen.
Health care is one of the biggest issues in this election. As president, I will ensure health care is a right, not a privilege — and give everyone the peace of mind they deserve. Read my full plan: https://t.co/ysfLJKi5xY
Climate change is an existential threat to our planet — we must take action. 

As president, not only will I recommit us to the Paris Agreement — I’ll lead the world to up the ante in addressing our climate emergency.

Corruption is Donald Trump’s middle name.
We need to build an economy that reflects our values.

My administration will reverse the Trump tax cuts for the super-wealthy and corporations. We'll then use that money to build a stronger, more inclusive middle class.
Obamacare was and is a big deal. It saved lives and gave millions peace of mind. We cannot afford to tear it down and start over — we should protect and build on it. https://t.co/34NCSYzoUa
It’s clear that Donald Trump has abused the power of the presidency. Full stop.

We have to fundamentally change the culture of how women are treated in this country. #DemDebate https://t.co/bvrK6yPvcd
Roe v. Wade is the law of the land. Period.

As president, Joe Biden will stand up to attacks on a woman’s constitutional right to choose and enshrine Roe into federal law. #DemDebate
Over the last few days, there has been a lot of misinformation on where Joe Biden stands when it comes to our marijuana laws. Read the facts below. #DemDebate https://t.co/JEgMfuBgLQ
25 years ago Joe Biden led the fight to pass the Violence Against Women Act and as president he’s going to build on it. #DemDebate

It's the Attorney General of the United States — not the president's private attorney. #DemDebate https://t.co/30yUe3jgCd
Joe will take on changing the culture on our college campuses that enables sexual violence, building on the #ItsOnUs effort he started with President Obama. #DemDebate  https://t.co/DKraGp9Cmi
Human rights should be at the core of our engagement with the world--not the periphery. As president, Joe Biden will hold accountable Saudi Arabia, China, and every nation that violates the human rights of their citizens. #DemDebate
Under President Trump, the North Korean nuclear threat is getting worse, not better. As President, Joe Biden will coordinate closely with our allies and hold China accountable for not putting pressure on North Korea. He'll see Kim Jong Un for what he is — a ruthless tyrant.
More than anything, we need a president who can deliver on climate change. Joe Biden has a proven record of bringing people together to achieve real, lasting solutions — at home and abroad. #DemDebate
It’s not who we are. We are better than this. #DemDebate https://t.co/Gyo93iKomX
Joe Biden is a statesman with decades of experience on the world stage who can repair our relationships around the world and is ready to command our armed forces on day one. #DemDebate
The next president will face a monumental task cleaning up Trump's mess. Joe Biden is the best candidate on the debate stage to immediately get to work restoring America’s place in the world. Because he’s done it before. #DemDebate
Joe Biden’s health care plan will offer a new choice for Americans: keep your private insurance or choose a public option like Medicare. #DemDebate https://t.co/Zy3E30WjYx
In a Biden Administration, plans with lower deductibles will become more affordable, coverage will be extended to more Americans, and the roughly 5 million low-income Americans who were denied Medicaid by their governors and/or state legislatures will finally gain coverage.
Let’s lay out the facts: More Americans prefer a public option over Medicare for All. #DemDebate https://t.co/j7K3fRNu92
Joe Biden has the quickest, most effective plan to achieve universal health care coverage - at 1/30th the cost of Medicare for All. And, he doesn’t get rid of employer-based health care. #DemDebate
We are fired up and ready for Joe to take the stage at tonight’s #DemDebate! https://t.co/V0iGMuq3yu
Hey folks, it’s @TeamJoe here! We’ll be taking over Joe’s account tonight to keep you updated on all things #DemDebate. Grab some ice cream and follow along! https://t.co/uXTJmM0dJH

@NRA The fight ahead of us is about more than just having plans. It’s about repairing our soul—and it will take someone with the proven ability to bring people together.

I've done it before—and at tonight's #DemDebate, I'm going to show you why I'm the best candidate to do it again.
@NRA When I talk about the soul of this nation—I’m talking about the values America stands for on the world stage. Values that have been tarnished by Trump.

I’m the only one on tonight's stage ready to rebuild our global reputation and restore our moral leadership on day one.
@NRA When I talk about the soul of this nation—I’m talking about the responsibility we have to our children to take on the threat of climate change.
 
I’m the only one on tonight’s stage who helped secure the Paris Agreement and the largest-ever U.S. investment in clean energy.
When I talk about the soul of this nation—I’m talking about a country where we can look our kids in the eye and tell them: “You will be safe at school.”

I’m the only one on tonight’s stage who has taken on the @NRA and won twice—and I can’t wait to do it again.
When I talk about the soul of this nation—I’m talking about a country where no one has to worry about whether they can afford health care.

I fought like hell to get Obamacare passed and I’m the only one on tonight’s stage who has led a transformation of our health care system.
This election is about the soul of our nation—and Donald Trump is poison to our soul. He has no regard for our Constitution and violates everything we stand for. It’s not hyperbole to say that this is about saving America.
 
We have to decide who we are and who we want to be.
I give you my word as a Biden: I will never stoop to President Trump's level. https://t.co/1CAhAjKEju
I am deeply disturbed by the news coming out of my law school alma mater, Syracuse University. We are truly in a battle for the soul of this nation, and it requires all of us to stand up together as a country against racism and bigotry. We must give hate no safe harbor. https://t.co/m6BNczblXY
On this Transgender Day of Remembrance, we honor the memory of those we’ve lost—at least 22 trans and gender non-conforming people killed this year—and recommit to ridding this hate-filled violence from our society. Everyone deserves to live open and proud and free without fear.
Something is wrong in America when the average Latina makes just over half what the average non-Latino white man makes. Donald Trump has undone much of what we did in the White House to fix the gender pay gap. When I'm president, I'll work to right that wrong. #LatinaEqualPayDay
This election is about the soul of our nation — and Donald Trump is poison to our soul.
I know we can beat Donald Trump in 2020—but we can’t do it without your help. We’re relying on grassroots donors like you to power this campaign and get our country back on track.

The energy at the @NVDems’ First in the West event was incredible. Folks are fired up to take back our country and make Donald Trump a one-term president.

I’ve witnessed the heroism of firefighters firsthand — selflessly rushing into danger to help others. They represent the best of our country. @DrBiden and I send our condolences to the loved ones of Worcester Fire Lt. Jason Menard for their loss. https://t.co/Oyru0eAhgq
Sunday night in a backyard. Monday morning at a store. We must do everything in our power to end this gun violence epidemic because we cannot go on like this any longer.

I’m inspired by the strength and resilience of Chrissy and survivors across the country, and proud of the change the Violence Against Women Act created, but we still have further to go.

China’s internment of nearly one million Uighur Muslims is among the worst abuses of human rights in the world today. The U.S. cannot be silent — we must speak out against this oppression and relentlessly defend human rights around the world. https://t.co/PQp04TWjyd
I’ve spent my entire career fighting the abuse of power. That’s what motivated me to write &amp; champion the Violence Against Women Act. The law helped change our culture—but there’s more work to do.

At the CNN Town Hall, I was asked what changes in American society I’m proudest of. Here’s what I had to say: https://t.co/X5OF6rwlJy
I’m running for president to rebuild the backbone of this country — the middle class. And this time, we have to bring everyone along regardless of race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or disability.
The American people deserve to know what the most corrupt president in modern history is hiding in his tax returns. https://t.co/QMMT8FEs3E
Trump's intervention in the American military justice system to pardon service members accused or convicted of war crimes betrays the rule of law, the values that make our country exceptional &amp; the men and women who wear the uniform honorably. He is not fit to command our troops.
The Foreign Service Officers who testified this week represent the best of America. They deserve our support &amp; thanks for their work to advance American interests, not the scorn &amp; harassment they get from the President. Every day, Donald Trump reminds us he's unfit to serve.
My favorite part of running for president is talking with people about their lives. So my team and I are going to pick someone to fly out to come meet me on the trail and share a meal, all expenses on us.

This ugly ideology has no place in America—it is both offensive and dangerous that it has taken root in the White House. Stephen Miller must go now. Then we must ensure Trump is shown the door in 2020—and that his hateful ideology never again is given a voice in the Oval Office.
We will beat the @NRA.

We will pass common-sense reforms. 

We must end our gun violence epidemic.

Another school shooting. How long will we go on like this? No kid should fear their safety in school &amp; no parent should worry whether their kid will come home.

Our hearts go out to Santa Clarita, but prayers aren't enough. We need real gun reform to make our schools safer.
The Affordable Care Act
An assault weapons ban
The Violence Against Women Act

There is no one in this race who has a stronger record of passing important, consequential legislation than I do. I know what it takes to get the job done.
The American people deserve to know what Donald Trump is hiding in his tax returns.

First Trump gave a green light to Erdogan to ethnically cleanse Kurds who helped us defeat ISIS. Now he welcomes Erdogan with open arms and sweetheart deals. It’s hard to avoid the conclusion that, once again, Trump’s personal interests, not US interests, are driving his policy.
We have to lead the world by our example and make clear that human rights, civil rights, and civil liberties matter to us. https://t.co/Ma26IxrInO

President Trump's erratic, impulsive decisions threaten our national security and set our world on edge. Every day that he sits in the Oval Office is a dangerous day for the United States. https://t.co/QcUR5hVCdJ

As president, I will ensure DREAMers are recognized as the Americans they are. In the meantime, the Supreme Court should overturn Donald Trump’s cruel decision so that DREAMers can continue to live fully in the only country they have ever known. Their #HomeIsHere.
I just finished tonight’s CNN Town Hall, where I laid out my vision for our future and how I’ll deliver real progress for working families.

I know we can defeat Donald Trump and take back this country, but we can’t do it without your help. Chip in today: https://t.co/x0ZyWHk0rC https://t.co/uw1YulnN2N
Donald Trump has violated his oath of office and betrayed our nation. He should be impeached. https://t.co/4YWvi0HLxh
At tonight's @CNN Town Hall in Iowa, I laid out my bold vision for the country and why I'm the best candidate in this race to beat Donald Trump and unite our nation.

If you liked what you heard, join our team and let's get to work: https://t.co/gnaFCAUzju
Looking forward to joining @ErinBurnett for tonight’s town hall in Iowa to discuss what’s at stake in this election and why I’m running for president. Tune in to @CNN at 9 PM ET to watch live.
Our veterans and their families represent the absolute best that our country has to offer. I had the honor of spending Veterans Day in Iowa with a few of them. https://t.co/ziNM4qRHL2
The campaign trail is always more fun when you join, @DrBiden. What a great weekend in New Hampshire! https://t.co/5zX5CZjM3N
President Trump has repeatedly failed our veterans, and our sacred obligation as a nation: to properly prepare and equip our troops when we send them into harm’s way, and care for them and their families. 

As president, I will meet our sacred obligation. https://t.co/TCUYaKtz8l
We owe our veterans more than we could ever repay — and it’s our sacred obligation to care for them and their families when they return home.

Thank you to all who have served — on Veterans Day and every day. https://t.co/SQBUj8nwmw
I understand the sleepless nights, wondering if your deployed child is safe, and all the added sacrifices military families face because their loved one chose selfless service.

As president, I'll take care of our troops and their families. https://t.co/iNuNHlPsg1
Less than 1% of our population risks everything to protect our country — the other 99% of us owe them more than we could ever repay. #VeteransDay https://t.co/ChF786cRlO
Today, I’m releasing my plan to ensure our veterans receive what they deserve: our respect and enduring gratitude, and the benefits they have earned.  

Read my full plan: https://t.co/TCUYaKtz8l
The most sacred obligation of our government is to do right by the men and women who defend our nation at war. Veterans Day offers us a moment to reflect on that obligation, and to recommit ourselves to all that it truly means. https://t.co/X0YAR8r3Xj
Together we can, and will, make Donald Trump a one-term president.
We don’t say it enough — Barack Obama was a great president. And I’m proud to have worked alongside him. https://t.co/5pIZxkNxyj
HBCUs and MSIs play a vital role in our communities. As president, I’ll invest $70 billion in these institutions to improve affordability, build high tech labs and facilities, and support student success.

Read my full plan: https://t.co/MxizpNiekL
I’m running for president to restore the soul of this nation, rebuild its backbone — the middle class, and unify all Americans.

If you’re with me, join us: https://t.co/qN0D1vhO9N
The ACA was, and is, a big deal. It took generations of presidents trying to expand health care access, and President Obama and I got it done. 

I’ll fight tooth and nail against anyone who tries to tear it down—Republican or Democrat.
There is no denying the devastating effects climate change has on our planet — we need to take action. 

As president, I’ll lead the world in addressing the climate emergency. Read my plan at https://t.co/FbsOsyQkIo.
https://t.co/hHMvdBHLY3
Thirty years ago today, the people of Berlin tore down a wall and vanquished a dictatorship. We must not forget the lessons of 1989. The United States must reclaim its mantle as the champion of democracy. The stakes are simply too high. https://t.co/3LkGwfzp6U
Because a union fought for their private health insurance plan, Marcy and her husband were able to retire with dignity and respect. That’s why my plan to protect and build on Obamacare will give folks the option to choose what’s best for them. https://t.co/jtOPJDnE30
My plan to build on Obamacare will expand health care coverage and lower costs — without raising taxes on the middle class.

Proponents of Medicare for All can't say the same. Read my full plan: https://t.co/ysfLJK0u9o
A fresh Fall day in New Hampshire spent serving chili to our nation’s finest — firefighters. https://t.co/9BRPyeDkLk
Health care is a right. Every American should have the peace of mind that comes from access to affordable health care, and we can get there by protecting and building on Obamacare.
We have to start rewarding work, not wealth. As president, I will build a stronger, more inclusive middle class — not cut taxes for the super wealthy.
Kids shouldn’t have to worry about their safety while they’re at school. Together — we’ll put an end to our gun violence epidemic. https://t.co/LvfaqNbpz7
This anniversary is not only a reminder of the cruelty these communities, especially Latinos, have tirelessly faced, but it is also a testament to their steadfast resilience in the face of prejudice to spark change, in California and across our country.
25 years ago, California approved Prop. 187 — a measure designed to strategically disenfranchise immigrant communities by stripping away access to health care and education.
President Trump’s trade war is reckless, and hurting our farmers every day. https://t.co/l1BIi9ffHm
It’s official — we’re on the ballot in New Hampshire. 

Join us: https://t.co/qN0D1vzpyn. https://t.co/UcwiuobICO
Every kid deserves a quality education and every family deserves to live in a safe, healthy community. That's why I support the California #SchoolsAndCommunitiesFirst initiative that will make corporations pay their fair share and invest in our communities to help them thrive.
I’m more optimistic about our future today than I was when I got elected to the Senate as a 29-year-old. If we unite this country, America’s best days still lie ahead.

If you agree, chip in today: https://t.co/ybhgvXSyRD
I led the successful fight in the 1980s to stop Jeff Sessions’ nomination for a federal judgeship. I hope the people of Alabama will stop him from rejoining the Senate next year.
As California continues to burn, President Trump wants to withhold critical aid and abandon our firefighters when they need our support the most. It's reckless and cruel.

We must act now on climate change and support our firefighters and those affected by this disaster. https://t.co/EahL0fozXo
The courage and determination of folks like @fred_guttenberg have turned the fight for gun safety reform from a cause to a movement.

Together, we will beat the @NRA and end our gun violence epidemic. https://t.co/IeJ4yOQ16q
Donald Trump wants to talk about corruption? That’s rich coming from the most corrupt president in modern history.

Tell Trump to release his taxes or shut up about corruption: https://t.co/hc4cbU9CL8 https://t.co/ozhDumIxsv
Getting the Violence Against Women Act passed is one of the highlights of my whole career. Now Senate Republicans are refusing to reauthorize it. To all the advocates and survivors speaking out - your voice makes all the difference. It always has. So keep it up. #VAWA4ALL
We’ve come too far with the Affordable Care Act to tear it down and start over. Building on Obamacare with a new public option is the best way to lower costs and achieve universal coverage. https://t.co/QbdijSL0se
Proud to stand with the @GeneralMills @RWDSU members in their fight for a fair contract. Every worker deserves the dignity that comes with fair wages, good benefits, and job security.
Every day that Donald Trump sits in the Oval Office, he proves how unfit he is to lead our country. We cannot give him eight years in the White House.
Last night's results showed that Democrats can take back our country, starting with Virginia, and begin the hard work of growing a stronger, more inclusive middle class and restoring the soul of our nation.

Chip in to help us take back the White House: https://t.co/Z9v6FGZH0r
I'm running for president to unite this country. There's nothing we cannot do if we do it together. https://t.co/RnwM8UEVUq
If you have DACA status, and it expires within the year, it’s critical that you renew as soon as possible to protect your status until we find a permanent solution.

To the millions of people who get up every single day and make this country work: I see you, and I will never stop fighting for you. You are the backbone of America. https://t.co/GdCmhoKtT8
Tonight, by voting in Democratic majorities in both chambers of the General Assembly, Virginians sent a clear, powerful message that will resonate across this nation and shake the walls of the White House. https://t.co/78UbWLWX4h
The growing mountain of evidence makes one thing clear: We must impeach Donald Trump. https://t.co/bPhLx6N79Z
I have fought for the Democratic Party my whole career. That’s not something everyone in this primary can say. https://t.co/JCNqAlbSo0
Obamacare protects over 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions — including Joe and Michelle’s son Matt. We cannot afford to tear it down and start over. We should protect and build on it. https://t.co/yX6jDCg8fG
Ten years ago today at Fort Hood. Two years ago in Sutherland Springs. In total, 39 lives taken because of our gun violence epidemic. We must honor the memory of those we lost with concrete action on gun safety reform.
Trump's Cuba policy hurts families on &amp; off the island. Administrations of both parties have supported family reunification, and I support @DebbieforFL &amp; @DonnaShalala's work to reunite Cuban families. As president, I will reinstate the Cuban Family Reunification Parole Program.
Proud to stand with folks in Las Vegas fighting against a proposed ordinance that effectively criminalizes homelessness. Like we did in the Obama-Biden Administration, we should focus on providing housing first and work to find long-term solutions to end homelessness.
The U.S. is the strongest nation in the world not just because of the example of our power, but also because of the power of our example.

That’s what has always set us apart on the world stage, and that’s something Donald Trump will never understand. https://t.co/omaa5OTMc0
Faith, hope, and dignity sound good to me. https://t.co/iVd6fc3qTy

250 days. @Senatemajldr McConnell, do your job and bring the universal background check bill up for a vote. https://t.co/rFzGmv4vDN
I’ve released 21 years of my tax returns — why hasn’t President Trump?

He should release his taxes or shut up about corruption. https://t.co/7NrKkagZlt
As the climate crisis worsens each day and California burns and Iowa floods, Trump continues to abandon science and our international leadership. He just notified the United Nations of our official withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. It's shameful. https://t.co/5UikQrsS3u
President Trump has turned his back on those he promised to help. He thinks he’s being tough with his trade war, but he’s really being reckless. And American workers are paying the price. 

I will ensure our policies put American workers first. https://t.co/oui5atVxXl
A country that ignores the threat to the very survival of this planet isn’t just troubled — it’s morally bankrupt.

We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and take urgent action to address the climate emergency.
Is anyone surprised that all it takes is a $100 saw to breach Trump’s wall? This whole exercise was a stunt and a sham from the beginning. The only thing the wall has succeeded in doing is tarnishing the image of our nation in the eyes of the world. https://t.co/9d8lNoCEth
This is a dangerous decision by the Trump Administration. We should be strengthening our clean water protections and holding polluters accountable for their actions — not loosening restrictions on toxic waste. https://t.co/asV8E9gCLb
This Tuesday, we have the opportunity to set an example for the nation  and turn the Virginia state legislature blue. But only if everyone turns out to vote: https://t.co/ZsLycRC1bv https://t.co/TVtZJQR9hI
In a Biden administration, we will lower health care costs and achieve universal coverage — and we will do it without raising taxes on the middle class. https://t.co/gm6jgUINzt
President Trump's decision to close America's doors to refugees fleeing persecution is cruel and shortsighted. As president, I will restore America's historic commitment to welcoming those whose lives are threatened by conflict and crisis. https://t.co/74BfkIbBPd

In one year, we will give Trump a nickname of his own: Former President Donald Trump.
We have one year to determine the mark Donald Trump will leave on our country. There's too much at stake to take the next year for granted. We must work together to take back the White House, win the Senate, hold the House and elect Democrats down the ballot. #OneYearOneTeam
Progress is bringing people together to get real results. It’s not accusing someone of being a Republican because they don’t share your approach to achieving universal health care. I know what it takes to get things done. I fought to pass Obamacare — I will fight to build on it.
The greed of drug companies fueled the opioid epidemic that has ravaged communities in every corner of the country. It’s time we hold pharmaceutical companies accountable.
https://t.co/bVjnbAskhr
Our military deserves a commander-in-chief who ensures they have what they need when we send them into harm's way. Donald Trump betrays this sacred obligation. By abandoning partners who risk everything to stand at our side, Trump makes every future mission harder for our troops. https://t.co/2271hS1Qia
No American should be denied shelter, medical care, or critical services because of who they are or who they love. As president, I will reverse these cruel and discriminatory acts from @realDonaldTrump and @mike_pence, and I'll start by signing the Equality Act into law. https://t.co/n3qFokakPd
The majority of middle class Americans don't think their kids will have the same standard of living they have — that's never happened before. Under my administration, every American will have a fighting shot. https://t.co/6QituGhlka
Once Donald Trump is out of the way, there is nothing we can’t do. https://t.co/LBk2gxdaTr
It all starts in Iowa, on February 3rd. Together, we're going to take this nation back from Donald Trump. https://t.co/9G1dQfBEzi
First thing I will do as president is rejoin the Paris Climate Accord and rally the world to push our progress further and faster. #LJ19 https://t.co/oo1jgDBk0M

Tonight in Iowa, a teacher asked me what my top priorities would be as president. Here's what I told him: https://t.co/LP7556f4sE
One of my great honors as Vice President was speaking at the Air Force Academy commencement. We need a President who respects our troops. https://t.co/KjtuyqWSUa
I did. It made clear that you pressured a foreign government to interfere in our political process on your behalf. You violated your oath of office and betrayed our nation.

You should be impeached. https://t.co/NrM2mmjzuo
I know it’s Halloween, but Donald Trump has really been scaring me lately.

Happy Halloween from the entire Biden family! We hope your night is filled with few tricks and plenty of treats. https://t.co/BVlT681L53
President Trump is undermining our health care and trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act at every turn. As a result, 400,000 additional children are uninsured. It’s cruel.

I will protect and build on Obamacare to ensure every American has access to the care they need. https://t.co/QkI00Jf805

Sorry America, the correct answer is Snickers. https://t.co/nJbSTf7C0d
Congress must do its duty to ensure that Donald Trump's assault on the Constitution does not seep beyond his presidency, with a lasting and devastating impact on our democracy. https://t.co/6zBWnwEpxI
The super-wealthy don’t need another tax cut. Period.

My administration will repeal the Trump tax cuts for the super-wealthy and reward work, not just wealth. https://t.co/jeNEA1TUjW
Donald Trump's erratic foreign policy has abandoned our allies, abdicated our leadership, and tarnished our reputation. It has to stop.

In a Biden administration, America will once again lead by example and rally the world to meet our common challenges. https://t.co/qPHYk6SaDF
Our planet cannot afford four more years of Donald Trump in the White House. https://t.co/r1e2ycnPfT
I’m not afraid to say the word union. America’s unions built the middle class — and in a Biden administration, we’ll work alongside them to rebuild it. https://t.co/VZnCFtAEEB
We are at a crucial moment. We can survive four years of Donald Trump, but if we give him eight years in the White House, he will forever alter the character of our nation. We cannot let that happen.

Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman’s testimony made clear what we already knew: Donald Trump pressured Ukraine to interfere in our elections on his behalf and the White House tried to cover it up.

We cannot let Trump get away with this abuse of power. He must be impeached. https://t.co/xiPCorMtsJ
President Trump’s reckless trade war is hurting farmers like Kevin—enough is enough.

Our farmers can't afford four more years of a leader who delivers nothing but empty promises. As president, I’ll stand up to China and pursue a trade policy that prioritizes American workers. https://t.co/4BvAhlRVoy
Proud to stand in solidarity with @TWULocal100 and @Transportworker in their fight for a fair contract. The 40,000+ bus and subway workers who move New York deserve the dignity that comes with fair wages, good benefits, and job security. #TWUrally2019
I’ve seen firsthand how hard educators work with little pay and few resources. We must do better. A Biden administration will ensure our educators finally receive the pay and dignity they deserve. https://t.co/lvtfAz1xIE

Every day that Donald Trump sits in the Oval Office is a dangerous day for the United States. His erratic, impulsive decisions threaten our standing in the world and make us all less safe. https://t.co/8FqfCPE7Rv

For too long, corporations have stifled workers’ right to organize and collectively bargain for the pay and benefits they deserve.

That ends with a Biden administration.

We will hold corporations and executives personally accountable for interfering with the rights of workers.

A job is about a lot more than a paycheck—it’s about dignity, it’s about respect, it’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say everything is going to be ok. Too many people today can’t say that.

We’ve got to rebuild the middle class and restore the dignity of work. https://t.co/we89bXzESZ
Today, I’m releasing my plan to strengthen worker organizing, collective bargaining, and unions.

To grow a stronger, more inclusive middle class — I'll make it easier for workers to unionize. It's time we start rewarding work, not wealth. Read my plan: https://t.co/c4MyVM48db. https://t.co/urgRVPu8pE
Congressman Elijah Cummings was a lion of democracy and a powerful ally in the fight for the soul of our nation. I am honored to have served alongside him and known him as a friend. May his passion and purpose live on as he rests in heavenly peace.
President Trump’s abdication of American leadership on climate change is dangerous. If we give him four more years, our planet may never recover.

On day one, I’ll rejoin the Paris Agreement and rally the world to push our progress further and faster. https://t.co/NTeEjxbYln
Donald Trump lacks the moral authority to lead our country. Every day he spends in the White House, he further debases the values and ideals of our nation. We must make him a one-term president.
If I'm elected president, my children will not sit in on Cabinet meetings or have offices in the White House. https://t.co/ouGpUpjyYJ
The powerful gun lobby has controlled our politics for far too long. Enough is enough. We the people own this country — not the @NRA.
Donald Trump inherited a growing economy from the Obama-Biden Administration. And just like everything else he’s inherited in his life — he’s in the process of squandering it. https://t.co/wZFKqjb8r2
The United States of America can be defined by one word: Possibilities. https://t.co/C9IKvhlHNk
I'm running for president to rebuild the backbone of our country—the middle class. And this time, we'll bring everyone along, so every American family can live a life of dignity.

If you’re with me, join the campaign by pitching in what you can today: https://t.co/mqQ09RPYuI
At a time when labor is under attack and Trump's reckless trade wars threaten millions more farms and families around the country, @TimRyan has been a clear voice for those at risk of being left behind. He'll continue to be a fierce force for them in Congress.
I strongly support the Senate's approval of North Macedonia's NATO membership. The countries of the Western Balkans deserve to be part of a Europe whole, free and at peace and we should be supporting Euro-Atlantic integration across the region. 
https://t.co/UUyOWL20z7
As president, I would press for dialogue to prevent further violence and instability. Investing in Haiti’s prosperity and security is in the national security interest of the United States.
The Trump Administration is abandoning the Haitian people while the country’s political crisis is paralyzing that nation. https://t.co/fdnCLnLQ0a
I'm proud to stand with @seiuhcpa and Regional Hospital of Scranton workers in their fight for higher wages, access to affordable health insurance, and a fair contract that invests in the future of their hospital.
Hoy estamos lanzando Todos con Biden. Los latinos han contribuido mucho a nuestro país—son parte del tejido de Estados Unidos y se merecen un presidente que les respete y que luchará junto a ellos.

Acompáñenme a continuar y mejorar los logros realizados: https://t.co/xa3EGpkpEf https://t.co/q04NjmAfmb
Today, we're launching Todos con Biden. Latinos have contributed so much to our country—you're part of the fabric of America &amp; you deserve a president who respects you &amp; will fight alongside you.

Join me as we continue to build on the progress we've made: https://t.co/7c2ZAB1Yf4 https://t.co/GChKfKsu12
Donald Trump has no idea what it means to be a part of the middle class. I do. https://t.co/ewJ1ZKymG6
Rooted in Scranton, fortified in the halls of Congress, and proven in the White House — my values have never changed, and they never will. I won’t stop fighting for the hardworking Americans who make our country run every single day. https://t.co/wNRzK1iso1
Let's get something straight — unions built the middle class. https://t.co/Zfp1rJP8NY
We all want the same thing — a life of dignity and a fair shot at a better future.

Donald Trump isn't capable of understanding that. https://t.co/XwojGzfmY2
WATCH LIVE: Joe Biden Speaks in Scranton, Pennsylvania https://t.co/yNWHciXiGS
This morning, I’ll be in my hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania, to discuss my plans to build a middle class where everyone comes along. Tune in at 10:00 AM ET to watch live: https://t.co/miqSzSTQfF
Once again, Putin and the Russians are interfering in the elections and trying to pick our president -- this time they're coming after me.

Chip in $5 to send the message to Putin that the American people decide elections, not him: https://t.co/6ehaYAjgxA https://t.co/o1GTKnizUY
This wasn’t the right word to use and I’m sorry about that. Trump on the other hand chose his words deliberately today in his use of the word lynching and continues to stoke racial divides in this country daily. https://t.co/mHfFC8HluZ
The moral obligation of our time is to restore, rebuild, and respect the backbone of America—the middle class. That mission will be my North Star as president.
Our gun and domestic violence epidemics are linked — and we must take action to end them both. Leader McConnell should allow a vote on the House-passed VAWA reauthorization to close loopholes and keep firearms out of the hands of dangerous individuals. https://t.co/ZSPWyJAgjl
Campbell is an incredible young man, and I’m proud to have played a small part in his journey.

To anyone working to overcome a stutter, my message is clear: never give up and never let it define you. #ISAD https://t.co/e7JRgVRV3a
There used to be a basic bargain in America—when your company did well, you shared in the prosperity. We must restore that bargain &amp; stand up to corporate profiteering.

I support @Teamsters25 as they strike against @RepublicService for a living wage, health care, and pensions.
Impeachment is not lynching, it is part of our Constitution. Our country has a dark, shameful history with lynching, and to even think about making this comparison is abhorrent. It's despicable. https://t.co/QcC25vhNeb
Las armas de asalto y los cartuchos de alta capacidad no tienen lugar en nuestras comunidades. Yo me enfrente al @NRA una vez antes para prohibirlos, y lo volveré a hacer en la Casa Blanca. https://t.co/e8TmUxKfej
We are truly in a battle for the soul of our nation, and it’s up to all of us to stand up and reject intolerance in all its forms. We must give hate no safe harbor. https://t.co/WeDGPCt9to
The Russian Facebook trolls are back — and this time, they're going after my campaign. We cannot let 2016 repeat itself.

Chip in $5 to our rapid response fund to help us fight back against their lies and foreign interference in our elections: https://t.co/6ehaYAjgxA https://t.co/9Zllaa9a5U
Donald Trump talks tough on trade but has nothing to show for it—other than pain for America's families. Mike Pence has been his complicit sidekick, propping up Trump’s reckless trade wars and slighting hard-working Americans across the country. https://t.co/DPQRNCeA0A
Assault weapons and high-capacity magazines have no place in our communities. I’ve taken on the @NRA to ban them once before, and I’ll do it again in the White House. https://t.co/e8TmUxKfej
After the most corrupt administration in modern history, the next president faces a big task: restoring faith in American government. A Biden administration will ensure our government works for all Americans — not just the powerful. https://t.co/Jy1UKwH7jd
In the United States, health care should be a right for all — not a privilege for the few. As president, I will give Americans a new choice — a Medicare-like public option — to ensure everyone has access to the quality, affordable care they need. https://t.co/gm6jgUrcaT
Donald Trump has asked three foreign governments to interfere in our elections on his behalf. In full view of the American people, he has violated his oath of office and betrayed our nation.

He must be impeached.
Four years of Betsy DeVos is more than enough. We’re going to make sure the next Secretary of Education is a teacher. https://t.co/6Bn4k3ATDl
I’m not going to be distracted by all of President Trump's lies, smears, distortions, and name-calling. I’m going to stay focused on the issues that matter to you—because action cannot wait when it comes to health care, or jobs, or education, or guns, or climate.
Thoughts and prayers won’t end our gun violence epidemic. 

It’s past time we take on the @NRA and pass common-sense gun safety reform — that starts with banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines and requiring universal background checks.
Hosting the G7 at Trump’s hotel? A president should never be able to use the office for personal gain.
Let’s be clear — the effects of climate change are devastating. We need to take action. 

As president, I’ll not only address this grave threat— I’ll lead the rest of the world in addressing the climate emergency. Read my plan at https://t.co/FbsOsz7VzW. https://t.co/llaQztOW1p
Our firefighters and teachers should not be paying a higher tax rate than the super-wealthy. We’ve got to rebuild the middle class and, this time, make sure everyone comes along.
These moments, getting to speak with all of you...that's what keeps me going. We need a leader who cares. That's why I'm running for President. https://t.co/Y5jRFMp2hX
President Trump has relentlessly fought to sabotage and repeal Obamacare — I will not stand for it. 

I will protect and build on Obamacare as president, ensuring every American has peace of mind when it comes to their health care. https://t.co/6khWa6SI78
This is what being bought and paid for by the @NRA looks like. It’s cowardly. https://t.co/Xes1Q5lUPB
President Trump withheld Congressionally appropriated aid to Ukraine unless they granted him a political favor. It's the definition of quid pro quo.

This is no joke—Trump continues to put his own personal, political interests ahead of the national interest. He must be impeached. https://t.co/puPgevx568
We’ve got to choose truth over lies — and that starts with getting Donald Trump out of the White House. https://t.co/j0FJxAS2f8
15 years ago, I worked to help pass the North Korea Human Rights Act. We made our values clear to the brutal regime in Pyongyang. Trump has instead made excuses for the dictator in the North and refuses to appoint a special envoy for human rights in NK. It is disgraceful.
.@realDonaldTrump, we have a message for you: release your tax returns or shut up about corruption.

Get yours today:
It is not just that Donald Trump is a liar. It is not just that he is corrupt. It is that every day he finds new ways to lie in an attempt to cover up his own corruption. https://t.co/FVh70mc8kh
Trump está restableciendo fondos específicos a Centroamérica. Yo apoyo la restauración de financiación total para abordar las causas de la crisis migratoria, incluyendo ayuda para el desarrollo, el cual reduce violencia/migración.

Congratulations for making history, @Astro_Christina and @Astro_Jessica. Because of you, every girl knows that even the stars are not beyond her reach. #AllWomanSpaceWalk
From day one, a Biden administration will be focused on rebuilding the backbone of our country — the middle class. And this time, we’ll make sure everyone comes along — regardless of race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or disability.
Venezuela’s election to the UN Human Rights Council is a travesty. Nicolás Maduro is a dictator, plain and simple. His regime’s human rights violations and extrajudicial killings have been documented by the UNHRC. https://t.co/n9DnSl5PfA
Trump is only reinstating “targeted” funds to Central America. I support full restoration of bipartisan funding to address root causes of the migration crisis—including the development aid proven to reduce violence and migration. Law enforcement alone is not enough. https://t.co/uJr34kTJ1I
Eliminate all private dollars from federal elections.

Overturn Citizens United and end dark money groups.

Ban lobbyists from donating to candidates they lobby.

It's time we ensure our government works for the people — not just the powerful.
When leaders like Admiral McRaven speak, we should listen. Donald Trump is a threat to our national security — his erratic, impulsive decisions make us all less safe. We cannot give him eight years in the White House. https://t.co/DjAa3seQqf
Donald Trump is the most reckless and incompetent Commander-in-Chief we’ve ever had.
Every young person deserves to be affirmed and accepted exactly as they are — regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. Today on #SpiritDay and every day, we must ensure LGBTQ youth hear that message loud and clear.
Proud to stand with @CTULocal1, @SEIU73, and every teacher and support staff member striking today for better staffing and quality schools for our students. It's time we support all workers with the pay and dignity they deserve. #FairContractNow

Elijah Cummings was a true public servant, his life defined by the love of his community and a fierce commitment to ensuring truth wins over power. The whole Biden family sends our condolences to his wife, Maya, his children, and the entire city of Baltimore. https://t.co/jYbvQwZI1a
The Kurds were integral in helping us defeat ISIS — and too many lost their lives. Now, President Trump has abandoned them. It's shameful.

I just stepped off the #DemDebate stage, where I laid out my bold vision for the country and how I’ll deliver real progress for working families.

If you liked what you heard tonight, help us keep our momentum going by pitching in: https://t.co/s5nd6p8r7o
We have an erratic, crazy president who knows not a damn thing about foreign policy and operates out of fear for his own re-election. #DemDebate https://t.co/t7vkrWX0CC
That’s all we have for tonight’s #DemDebate! Make sure to follow @TeamJoe to stay up-to-date on everything happening on our campaign. https://t.co/tidV9ZfqT2
Joe Biden is the only candidate on the #DemDebate stage who has actually beaten the @NRA — and he did it twice.

As president, he will ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines once again. #DemDebate https://t.co/5i5GcRJDr7
Let’s put this in perspective: if you eliminate every single solitary soldier, tank, satellite, nuclear weapon, eliminate the Pentagon and it would only pay for 4 months of Medicare for All. 4 months.

Where do the other 8 months come from? Your paycheck. #DemDebate
Roe v. Wade is the law of the land. Period.
 
As president, Joe Biden will stand up to attacks on a woman’s constitutional right to choose and enshrine Roe into federal law. #DemDebate
Medicare for All will cost at least $30 trillion over 10 years — and it will be paid for in part by raising taxes on middle class families.

Joe Biden has a better plan — he will protect and build on Obamacare to ensure everyone has access to quality, affordable health care. https://t.co/Yg5auxKojQ
Joe Biden has a bold plan to end our gun violence epidemic. But it’s going to take more than plans—it’s going to take leadership and a proven ability to get things done.

He's banned assault weapons and high-capacity magazines before &amp; he'll do it again. https://t.co/AbTUKdY7Bv https://t.co/cHd98KZqLx
Three — that's how many times President Trump asked foreign governments to interfere in our political process.

Why? Because he's scared. He knows Joe Biden will beat him like a drum. #DemDebate https://t.co/ddRoalUIdt
The United States has a vital national interest in Syria to ensure the lasting defeat of ISIS. We know that this terrorist group plotted to attack our homeland in the past, and we cannot let that threat re-emerge. #DemDebate
Donald Trump betrayed our partners in the Syrian Democratic Forces and put at risk our gains against ISIS. This is a disaster of his own making. #DemDebate
As president, Joe Biden will repeal Trump’s tax cuts for corporations and the super-wealthy, and build a tax code that rewards work, not just wealth. #DemDebate
Our firefighters and teachers work tirelessly to make our communities safer, better places to live. They should not pay a higher tax rate than the super-wealthy. #DemDebate
On day one, Joe Biden will move to:

✅ Eliminate the Trump tax cut for the super-wealthy
✅ Eliminate the unjustified loopholes in our tax code
✅ Use that money to invest in America’s future

#DemDebate
Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in modern American history. He must be impeached. #DemDebate https://t.co/2MJI33u28D
We can’t beat Donald Trump with double talk on health care.

Joe Biden doesn’t just know what his health care plan is—he knows how much it would cost, and how he would pay for it. #DemDebate https://t.co/2EnBmoFTft
Medicare for All will cost *checks notes* 30x more than Joe Biden's plan to protect and build on Obamacare — and it will be paid for in part by raising taxes on middle class families. #DemDebate https://t.co/ICr2E7wFJ8
“Russia, if you’re listening…”

“I would like you to do us a favor…” to Ukraine’s president

“China should start an investigation.”

Our President has asked three foreign powers to intervene in our elections on his behalf — and those are just the ones we know about! #DemDebate
A president who puts his own self-interest ahead of the public good and national security poses a threat to each and every American in our daily lives.

Donald Trump should be impeached. Period. #DemDebate https://t.co/eY2DAPne5d
Hey everyone — @TeamJoe here! We’re taking over the account to keep you in the loop on tonight’s #DemDebate. Make sure to follow along for updates! https://t.co/RkPKbgDexW
Folks, we have to do more than beat Donald Trump.

We have to beat him like a drum.

When I take the #DemDebate stage tonight, I'm going to show you that I'm the best candidate to do just that.

Let's go.
From the Voting Rights Act renewal, to the ban on assault weapons, to the Violence Against Women Act, to Obamacare, to the Recovery Act that kept us from sliding into a Depression, I’ve delivered progress for you.

I know what it takes to get it done.
Fixing what's broken in this country will take vision—and yes, it will take plans. But that’s not enough.

It also takes the proven ability to get it done. And there is no one on tonight's stage who has a stronger record of passing important, consequential legislation than I do.
This election is about you. Your children. Your family. And you can’t wait for a president fighting for you when it comes to health care, or jobs, or education, or guns, or climate. The world can’t wait for America to once again lead a stable, peaceful international order.
For days, pundits have let Donald Trump define the conversation around tonight's #DemDebate.

Well, Trump doesn't get to pick the Democratic nominee. And I’m not going to be distracted by all his lies, smears, distortions, and name-calling. He’s picked a fight with the wrong guy.
Philadelphia's office cleaners work hard every day to keep the city's buildings clean. They deserve the dignity that comes with a living wage, access to health care, and a secure retirement. I stand with @32BJSEIU cleaners in their fight for a fair contract. #BuildingJustice
Overturning Citizens United isn’t enough. Ridding our politics of big money and corporate special interests demands more. We must go further.

I will introduce a constitutional amendment to get all private dollars out of our federal elections.
President Trump is leading the most corrupt administration in modern American history. It’s got to end.

We must restore integrity to our government and ensure our elected officials work for all Americans — not just the powerful. https://t.co/81eLH8nrvX
Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in modern American history.
The news from Fort Worth is heartbreaking. Atatiana Jefferson should still be alive today. We cannot allow this to keep happening, we must reform our policing practices and hold officers accountable for their actions. https://t.co/f18kAHbFWH
Donald Trump is the definition of corruption. At every turn, he has abused the power of the presidency to benefit his bottom line and weaponized the Executive Branch to serve himself.

I’ll ensure our government works for the people—not just Donald Trump. https://t.co/oZnl5qySmw
America was built on a simple proposition: we're all created equal. We haven't yet fully lived up to that ideal, but we've never stopped trying.

Transgender folks deserve every right afforded to Americans — and as president, I will fight to secure those rights. https://t.co/LvcqOZOxWq
On #IndigenousPeoplesDay, we recognize the resiliency of indigenous communities and celebrate their rich contributions to society—while recommitting to the work that remains to come to terms with our past as a nation, to honor our promises, and work to right our wrongs.
Our Constitution begins with three simple words, “We the People” — not “We the Donors.” But for too long, corporations and special interests have corrupted our political process and rigged it in their favor.

Today, I’m releasing my plan to change that: https://t.co/iGrbvPmRlF
Corporations should not value their profits over the health and safety of their employees. As president, I will significantly increase the number of inspectors within the pork and beef industries to ensure every individual has safe working conditions. https://t.co/5KrOfy2ldD
President Trump betrayed our partners, the Syrian Democratic Forces, and endangered our hard-won gains against ISIS. Our troops are left in the middle of a war with no plan other than retreat.

He has failed as Commander-in-Chief to safeguard our country &amp; protect our troops. https://t.co/8dZyqUYNUk
Donald Trump is a threat to our democracy. He must be impeached.
It is wonderful to see Sesame Street raising awareness about the effect of substance use disorder on families. We need to be doing more to help parents experiencing addiction and support children who end up in foster care because of this issue. https://t.co/SItckU6oWk
The Affordable Care Act has been under relentless attack for the past nine years — I will not stand for it. As president, I will protect and build on the ACA to ensure every American has peace of mind when it comes to their health care. https://t.co/uw7Kk16p6a
Thank you, @UFCW! I promise you won’t have a better ally in the White House if I’m president. I’m a union guy and always have been. Together, we can restore the soul of this nation. https://t.co/Cmutbywwth
I’m about to take the stage at the @UFCW Presidential Forum in Iowa, where I’ll discuss my plans to strengthen America’s unions. Tune in to watch live: https://t.co/0Ail0AXGgA
The devastating effects of gun violence don’t end when the shooting is over—survivors may face mental health and substance use disorders in the months and years that follow.

Enough is enough. We must end this epidemic. https://t.co/RPDUEeRTyd
@SarahEMcBride @MaraKeisling @NCTEActionFund Thanks Sarah. I'm proud of you and so is Beau.
A good education should be a reliable pathway to the middle class—not saddle you with mountains of debt. My new plan will provide two years of community college without debt, double Pell grants, invest $50 billion in workforce training programs, and more. https://t.co/lU9sfUkPUG
Immigrants have always made us stronger as a nation — our diversity has always been our greatest strength. Donald Trump doesn’t get that. https://t.co/DjftXcvs09
President Trump's attacks on Congresswoman Omar and Somali refugees have no place in our nation — let alone the White House.

A president should unite us around our shared goals and lift us up, not stoke the flames of hatred and tear us down. https://t.co/WpWikGYt4b
I was proud to work with Matthew’s parents, Judy and Dennis, to extend our hate crimes law to cover sexual orientation and gender identity. But there’s still more work to be done — we can’t rest until every single American can live open and proud without fear.
21 years ago, Matthew Shepard passed away after a brutal anti-gay hate crime — an attack that shook the conscience of our nation. As we honor his memory, we must remember that members of the LGBTQ community — especially trans women of color — are still targeted with violence.
President Trump believes he can and will get away with anything he does. We all laughed when he said he could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot someone and get away with it.

Now, he is shooting holes in our Constitution. We cannot let him get away with it.
We believe Americans should decide American elections. But Trump will do anything to get re-elected, including violating the most basic norms of our democracy. It's dangerous.

We cannot give him four more years in the White House.
Our planet is at a critical moment — and if we re-elect Donald Trump, it may never recover.

On day one, I’ll take action to reverse the damage done by this administration and put America on track to lead the world in addressing the climate emergency. https://t.co/LP25Ii1xA2
Let me make something clear to President Trump: I’m not going anywhere.

You’re not going to destroy me. And you’re not going to destroy my family. I don’t care how dirty the attacks get.
Living open and proud is a daily act of bravery — bravery that resides in the heart of every single LGBTQ individual.

To those who have come out and to those who haven’t, know that I’m proud of you. You are loved and you are accepted just as you are. #ComingOutDay
Today is a reminder to every girl on the planet: nothing is beyond your capacity or capability. And all of us must work to ensure that girls around the world have the chance to participate fully in society and that their rights are respected. #DayoftheGirl
To LGBTQ people suffering persecution anywhere: the American people are on your side. And as president, I will ensure the U.S. leads the world to defend human rights for all.
LGBTQ rights are human rights. Uganda's proposed new law is inhumane. Using religion or culture to license discrimination is never justifiable. Period. https://t.co/m54xkTraqm
Using religion or culture to discriminate against or demonize LGBTQ individuals is never justified—not anywhere in the world.

I will send a clear message from the top of our government: prejudice is prejudice, inhumanity is inhumanity, and the U.S. will not stand for it. https://t.co/HUMcFVSSfA
I spent my night at the HRC forum talking about the fundamental respect every human being deserves. You spent yours showing how little respect for anyone else you have. America is so much stronger than your weakness, @realDonaldTrump.
Honored to be asked a question at tonight's #EqualityTownHall by my friend Judy Shepard. It was a privilege to work with her to secure the passage of legislation that extended our hate crimes laws to crimes based on sexual orientation and gender identity.
We have to make sure that no hospital or health care provider can discriminate against someone simply because of who they are or whom they love. #EqualityTownHall https://t.co/bVgmfgSA06
There is no distinction between mental health and physical health — it’s health. Period. We've got to combat the stigma and ensure everyone has access to the care they need and deserve. #WorldMentalHealthDay
Looking forward to joining @AndersonCooper at tonight’s #EqualityTownHall to discuss the work that remains in the fight for LGBTQ rights. Tune in to CNN at 8PM ET to watch live.
For all the hard-won progress we've made in the fight for LGBTQ equality, we're not done — not nearly.

We must stand up to President Trump's dangerous attacks on the rights of the LGBTQ community and continue to fight for full equality. https://t.co/Wtxpczcawj
Americans should decide American elections. Period. https://t.co/oc5HavIiuf
I sat down with @MaraKeisling of the @NCTEActionFund to discuss the progress we’ve made on LGBTQ rights and the work that remains. Transgender equality is the civil rights issue of our time—I won’t stop fighting until everyone is treated with the dignity and respect they deserve. https://t.co/zaLAdKWBrV
President Trump picked a fight with the wrong guy. https://t.co/5s7izCLSzt
Trump made this decision on a whim, after a phone call with Turkish President Erdogan. There was no process. No consultation with our military, our diplomats, or our allies. Trump got rolled, plain and simple, because he has no idea what he's doing.
But that's not all — he betrayed our brave troops, who sacrificed alongside them. He betrayed our word as a nation — raising doubts among our allies around the world about America's security commitments.
Donald Trump sold out the Syrian Democratic Forces — the courageous Kurds and Arabs who fought with us to smash ISIS's caliphate — and he betrayed a key local ally in the fight against terrorism. https://t.co/VWJDpISjy2
In full view of the American people, Donald Trump has violated his oath of office and betrayed this nation. He must be impeached. https://t.co/ivRAqnHHZb
President Trump has decided that we don't have the power or the political will to hold him accountable. He's not just testing us — he's laughing at us.

We must prove him wrong. He must be impeached. https://t.co/4ahsVPiqxX
Like every bully, President Trump is lashing out because he’s afraid. He’s afraid of how badly I will beat him next November.

Let’s make his worst fear a reality: https://t.co/a9zec0IrRf https://t.co/kjrK3mzzjk
Only a little farther north, Timothy Ragland won his race to become both the youngest and first African American mayor of Talladega. I'm confident they will serve the people of Alabama well.
Last night, history was made in the birthplace of the civil rights movement, when Steven Reed became the first African American mayor of Montgomery.
President Trump sees no limit to his power. He believes he can — and will — get away with anything he does. https://t.co/wxCjXIubfM
To preserve our Constitution, our democracy, and our basic integrity — Donald Trump should be impeached. https://t.co/fa14AGZdW9
Two days ago, Trump impulsively gave Turkey a green light to invade Syria, blindsiding our military. Today, we see the consequences—Turkish forces attacking the fighters that helped us take on ISIS. It’s a betrayal, takes pressure off the terrorist threat, &amp; leaves us less safe.
Every day Donald Trump is in the White House, he poses a grave threat to our democracy. We must make him a one-term president.

Help us defeat him by pitching in to our Beat Trump Fund before midnight: https://t.co/wNHtfGmXsv
With his words and with his actions, President Trump has indicted himself.

He should be impeached.
Thanks for watching. Stop stonewalling the Congress. Honor your oath. Respect the Constitution.

And speaking of taxpayers, I’ve released 21 years of my tax returns. You? https://t.co/CrqOQG8YXb
Join me now as I take the stage: https://t.co/xQ62JANeIt
I’m about to take the stage in New Hampshire to discuss the grave threat Donald Trump poses to our democracy and the action we must take. Tune in now: https://t.co/PNjixxCxrn
This afternoon, I’ll be speaking about President Trump’s abuse of power and the grave threat he poses to our democracy. Tune in at 12:45 PM ET to watch live. https://t.co/PNjixxCxrn
Jill and I send our best wishes to those taking part in the Hindu festival of Navratri. As the nine days of celebration come to a close, let us remain optimistic of the triumph of good over evil and the opportunity of new beginnings.
I have spent my entire career fighting the abuse of power.

Donald Trump has spent his entire career abusing his power.
In public and in private, President Trump has asked foreign governments to interfere in our elections on his behalf. It is an abuse of power. We cannot let him get away with it.

Chip in to our Trump Rapid Response Fund to help us respond: https://t.co/1mJbMuzbH0 https://t.co/vPYBDxo3Nz
Jill and I wish Jewish communities around the world an easy fast as they gather to observe Yom Kippur. The Day of Atonement is an important reminder of the obligation we all share to reflect on our actions and recommit to our values in the year ahead. L’Shana Tovah.
President Trump must stop stonewalling Congress and fully cooperate with the investigations. The American people deserve the truth. https://t.co/WhO9offwUN
No one should live in fear of being fired because of who they are or whom they love. We must stand up to President Trump’s relentless attacks on LGBTQ rights and continue the fight for full equality—because every American deserves to live open, proud, and free. #RiseUpOct8
We will make historic investments in education and training to ensure every American has a reliable path to the middle class—regardless of their parents’ income or the color of their skin.

Wondering how the plan will benefit you? Take the quiz: https://t.co/ba2juUMDUk https://t.co/eBrukAxvzw
Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority-Serving Institutions play a vital role in our communities. A Biden administration will invest $70 billion in these institutions to improve affordability, build high tech labs and facilities, and support student success.
A Biden administration will take concrete action to address the student debt crisis in our country. We will expand access to Pell Grants, more than halve income-based payments on undergraduate federal student loans, and make student loan forgiveness work for public servants.
.@DrBiden calls community colleges America’s best kept secret — she's right. A Biden administration will invest in these institutions, providing every American with two years of community college or other high-quality training programs without debt.
A good education should be a reliable pathway to the middle class. But for too many, earning a credential or degree after high school comes with a mountain of debt or is out of reach altogether.

Today, I’m releasing my plan to change that: https://t.co/lU9sfUkPUG
Firefighters and teachers should not pay a higher tax rate than the wealthiest in our country. As president, I will reverse President Trump’s tax cuts for the super-wealthy and create a tax code that works for the middle class.

It’s time we reward work, not just wealth.
Abuse of power is the defining characteristic of the Trump presidency.

Donald Trump has abused the foreign policy of the United States to extract personal, political favors from multiple countries.

We must stop him. https://t.co/5IojhccVq3
Today, I'm proud the campaign is launching Women for Biden. There's so much at stake in this election — and so much more work to do in the fight for women's health care, paychecks, safety, and families: https://t.co/ZYn4CXKuc1 https://t.co/54v5rS7XLD
As president, I will make passing the Equality Act a top legislative priority. A Biden administration won’t rest until we truly achieve full equality, and everyone is treated with dignity and respect under the law.
A president should use the full might of the executive branch to secure justice, dignity, and safety for all. Instead, President Trump does the opposite — callously exerting his power over the most vulnerable.

We must send a clear message: We will not stand for this.
This week, the Trump Administration is set to argue before the Supreme Court that it’s legal to discriminate against someone simply because of who they are or whom they love. It’s a dangerous attack on the civil rights of LGBTQ Americans and everything we stand for.
We cannot, and will not, stand for President Trump’s corruption. We will beat him like a drum.
If we stand together we can, and will, end our gun violence epidemic. Read my full plan to address this public health epidemic at https://t.co/AbTUKdGwcV.
https://t.co/SjcCZfVbK7
President Trump continuously dishonors everything it means to hold the office of President of the United States of America. We must make him a one-term president.
Elena @De11eDonne is the pride of Delaware. Wishing her well as she recovers — we need more professional athletes like her sharing their support for inclusive sports. I'm looking forward to seeing her back on the court soon.
In my experience, asking a foreign government to manufacture lies about your domestic political opponent is not “done all the time.” https://t.co/w8K8C17yUj
No family should be struggling to make ends meet. American farmers are hurting as a result of President Trump’s broken promises — his trade war is reckless. 
 
As president, I’ll stand up to China and pursue a trade policy that prioritizes American workers.https://t.co/r2xsaneMlf
Our planet just experienced the hottest September on record — yet President Trump continues to dismiss the devastating effects of climate change. As president, I’ll address this grave threat and lead the world in addressing our climate emergency.
https://t.co/btVh7yDdgD
It's clear who President Trump works for. He gave giant tax cuts to the super-wealthy and corporations. Now, he’s cutting food stamp funding for the 3rd time. It’s cruel.

No family should go hungry in America. https://t.co/sy6lGkp1bF
Jill and I are devastated to hear about last night’s shooting in Kansas City. No one should ever have to fear that they, or their loved ones, may not return home due to senseless violence.

We must come together as a country to put an end to these tragedies once and for all.
Every day it becomes clearer, we cannot give Donald Trump four more years in the White House. Stand with me, and together we can make him a one-term president: https://t.co/BKuXG8A15i
And to Trump and those who facilitate his abuses of power, and all the special interests funding his attacks against me: Please know that I’m not going anywhere. You won’t destroy me, and you won’t destroy my family. And come November 2020, I intend to beat you like a drum.
While the House does its job on impeachment, I’m going to stay focused on what matters: improving the lives of Americans and fighting to ensure that the United States is once again the leader of the free world.
It’s the same cynical playbook he returns to again and again. But this time it won’t work, because the American people know me—and they know him. I will put the integrity of my whole career in public service to this nation up against Trump’s lack of integrity any day of the week.
Our first president, George Washington, famously could not tell a lie. Trump seemingly cannot tell the truth — about anything. He slanders anyone he sees as a threat. It's why is he is frantically pushing flat-out lies, debunked conspiracy theories and smears against me.
Every day, more evidence is uncovered revealing that Trump is abusing the power of the presidency and is wholly unfit to be president. He is using the highest office in the land to advance his personal, political interests instead of the national interest.
https://t.co/NNpDITpwBV
Obamacare was, and is, a big deal. It covered 20 million additional Americans, protects over 100 million with pre-existing conditions, and has saved lives.

We can’t afford to tear it down and start over. As president, I will protect and build on it. https://t.co/Wm7cm9sMEi
President Trump is spending millions of dollars attacking me because he's scared I'll beat him.

But I’m not going anywhere. I won’t let Donald Trump choose the Democratic nominee. https://t.co/k2YNjnlfEU
Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in modern history. https://t.co/EjfAKdivy7
We have a president who believes he is above the law and that there is no limit to his power.

He is wrong. We cannot let him get away with this.

Chip in to help us beat him like a drum: https://t.co/d6wGkKd85B https://t.co/Gf3fKwixVA
Roe v. Wade is the law of the land, and we must fight any and all attempts to overturn it. As president, I will codify Roe into law and ensure this choice remains between a woman and her doctor. https://t.co/kaJbYWcYhL
Health care is personal to me like it is for so many Americans. I promise you, as president, I will protect your family's health care as I would my own. https://t.co/BTS5MW1J7J
It has been 219 days since the House passed the bipartisan universal background check bill. Every day since, @senatemajldr McConnell has refused to bring it up for a vote.

Enough. How many more Americans must die for Senate Republicans to stand up to the @NRA and take action?
Looking forward to joining @SEIU at the #UnionsForAll Summit this afternoon to talk about my plans to protect and strengthen America’s unions and rebuild the middle class. Tune in: https://t.co/gXE6IEZjvn
This is who Donald Trump is.

A president who abuses the power of the Oval Office to win re-election, turns his back on the fight for democracy in Hong Kong, and puts his own self-interest above the public good.

We have to show the world who we are. https://t.co/Bn24RHqQua
Extreme risk laws save lives. Period.

As president, I will incentivize states to adopt these important laws to help keep guns out of dangerous hands.

Read my full plan to end our gun violence epidemic: https://t.co/AbTUKdY7Bv https://t.co/gVurhsNdlO
It's clear President Trump doesn't care about the farmers and manufacturers being crushed by his reckless trade war—just this week, 160 workers were laid off in the Quad Cities. Enough.

As president, I will end these failed policies and put American workers first. https://t.co/nwHvMTc3N9
I’m not surprised President Trump asked foreign governments for help to beat me and that his special interest friends are spending millions to attack me.

But we can't let the lies, smears, and distortions distract us from what's at stake in this election. https://t.co/RE9qQ59wHB
The idea of Donald Trump attacking anyone’s integrity is a joke.
Our children should not have to worry about their safety at school. Enough is enough. We must take action to end our gun violence epidemic.

https://t.co/AbTUKdY7Bv https://t.co/FKVffIr49h
You should need to pass a background check to buy a gun. Period.

I will enact universal background check legislation and close loopholes that allow guns to fall into the wrong hands.

Read my full plan to end gun violence: https://t.co/AbTUKdGwcV https://t.co/pEl8KBvwct
Mr. President, you cannot extort foreign governments to help you win re-election. It’s an abuse of power. It violates your oath of office. And it jeopardizes our national security. I know you want to rig the primary and pick your opponent, but I’m not going anywhere. https://t.co/LZQ8W3fmU6
We’re going to do more than just beat President Trump — we’re going to beat him like a drum. https://t.co/A09Dh7Uqmp
All the progress we've made on domestic violence and sexual assault has been because of people like Bonnie Campbell. Grateful for her kind words in reflecting on the history of the Violence Against Women Act. https://t.co/tROLeoy3Me
I will put the integrity of my whole career in public service to this nation up against President Trump's long record of lying, cheating, and stealing any day of the week. https://t.co/ABf0robBtr
Because of the courage and determination of folks like @GabbyGiffords and groups like @AMarch4OurLives, the fight for gun safety reform has gone from a cause to a movement.

We will end our gun violence epidemic — together. #2020GunSafety https://t.co/khPWpR0FOc
President Trump broke his promise to America's farmers. He campaigned on having their backs, but now his administration is abandoning them and claiming family farms might not survive.
 
I will expand opportunities for our farmers — not count them out. https://t.co/8MHkvP8v6E
52 years ago, Thurgood Marshall became the first African American Supreme Court Justice. A legal giant in the struggle for civil rights—he relentlessly pushed America closer to our promise of liberty, equality, and justice for all. His voice forever changed the course of history.
En el 1994, el senador Feinstein y yo dirigimos la lucha para prohibir las armas de fuego para asalto y las revistas de alta capacidad. Luchamos contra el @NRA y los vencimos.

Como presidente, volveré a prohibir estas armas de guerra. Las sacaremos de nuestras calles.
In 1994, Senator Feinstein and I led the fight to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. We took on the @NRA and got it done.

As president, I’ll ban these weapons of war once again. We will get them off our streets.

https://t.co/AbTUKdY7Bv https://t.co/u06FKHQv6D
I'm about to take the stage at the #2020GunSafety Forum in Las Vegas to discuss my track record of taking on the @NRA and my new plan to end our gun violence epidemic.

This is not how an American president should act. https://t.co/qSrijMhhun
.@DrBiden and I are sending our best wishes to @BernieSanders, Jane, and the whole Sanders family. Anyone who knows Bernie understands what a force he is. We are confident that he will have a full and speedy recovery and look forward to seeing him on the trail soon.
President Trump is morally unfit to lead our country. https://t.co/r3SKYqK26K
President Trump asked a foreign government to interfere in our elections, and now he's spending $10 million on attack ads against me. It's clear that he is trying to influence the primary and pick his opponent.

Why? Because he knows I’ll beat him like a drum.
Weapons of war have no place on our streets.

We must take on the @NRA and ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. I’ve done it before, and I’ll do it again in the White House. https://t.co/hdVTM6YVF7
One of my favorite parts of debate night has become meeting our contest winners from around the country. God love ya, JoAnne. Thanks for coming to Houston.

The brave people of Hong Kong deserve the full support of the United States as they demand the civil liberties and autonomy promised to them. Violent suppression is unacceptable. The world is watching. https://t.co/ruOJWceLYr
President Trump works for the @NRA.

I’ll work for the American people. https://t.co/vnuXbsWfDM
Two years ago, we watched in horror as 58 precious lives were cut short in the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history. As we remember those we lost in Las Vegas, we must honor them with action. We cannot let the scourge of gun violence tear our communities apart any longer.
Wonder why President Trump is lying about me? It's because he knows that I will beat him like a drum.

Chip in $5 before tonight’s public fundraising deadline to help us defeat Donald Trump and stop the outrageous lying and cheating he engages in: https://t.co/I2jAPpnURl https://t.co/yWcclnx5Zo
Being middle class isn’t a number. It’s a value set. It’s about the issues that matter to every American family: a good education, economic opportunity, access to quality, affordable health care.

We've got to rebuild the middle class and, this time, ensure everyone comes along.
Harris County Deputy Sandeep Dhaliwal was a hero and a trailblazer who selflessly served his community every day. @DrBiden and I are keeping his family and loved ones in our hearts. https://t.co/82ex0246hj
Grateful for the leadership of @fred_guttenberg for finding purpose in tragedy.

We will beat the @NRA and end our gun violence epidemic. https://t.co/V5FaK1xDnu
President Trump is trying to hijack this election. We cannot let him get away with it.
We can combat climate change.
We can end our gun violence epidemic.
We can ensure every American has access to quality, affordable health care.

It’s all within our reach if we unite this country. There’s not a single thing we cannot do — together.
We must end this epidemic of violence against the transgender community — especially trans women of color. It’s up to all of us to stand up and give hate no safe harbor.

Every American deserves to live open, proud, free and without fear. https://t.co/zdfQYpEpbZ
Let’s be clear, this attack is designed to weaken our unions and take away workers’ voices on the job. It’s wrong. I stand with Alaska’s public employees. https://t.co/MbZxu1Ayzz
The science is clear: we cannot wait to take action on climate change.

On day one, I’ll take unprecedented steps to rally the world and tackle this crisis head on. We can and will solve this — together. https://t.co/YPymjqJZzv
On Monday, $255 million in funding expires for historically black colleges and universities and minority-serving institutions. Senate Republicans need to pass the #FUTUREAct now. Our students and educators cannot afford to wait. https://t.co/tY4o2T36AN
President Trump is trying to hijack this election to distract from how he has turned his back on America's families: sabotaging our health care, prioritizing tax cuts for the super-wealthy, and rolling back our progress on climate change.

We won't let him get away with it.
To everyone in the Jewish community, @DrBiden and I wish you a very happy, healthy, and sweet New Year. #RoshHashanah https://t.co/vSwRbJWKlz
The Trump Administration is responsible for the largest reduction in federally protected land — it’s wrong. As president, I will reverse President Trump's actions and protect our precious federal lands for generations to come. #NationalPublicLandsDay  https://t.co/PMh0u3rvWc
We need to take the next step in improving our nation’s health care system. The Affordable Care Act was an historic first step — we need to build on it, not start from scratch. I’ll protect and build on Obamacare to ensure everyone has access to affordable, quality health care.
It is long past time to address the devastating effects of climate change. As president, I will take action against those who knowingly harm our environment. https://t.co/6BHbmlVB37
It’s clear — we are in a battle for the soul of this nation. It’s time to pick our heads up and show the world who we are. We are the United States of America — there is nothing beyond our capacity.
Yesterday in Las Vegas, we discussed the crucial need to address the gun violence epidemic. Folks, it’s time to pass common-sense gun safety legislation. I’ve beaten the @NRA twice — and as president, I’ll do it again. https://t.co/5wRme6TCoJ
Donald Trump has turned his back on America’s families. It’s time we rewarded work, not just wealth. https://t.co/AwSdIyY11l
In America, health care should be a right for all. But time and again, President Trump has made it harder for underrepresented and underserved communities to access the affordable, quality health care they need.

It's shameful, and as president, I will reverse his actions. https://t.co/CkgGpAekrl
We are not a country that detains migrant children indefinitely or denies them access to soap, toothbrushes, or beds.

We are a country that welcomes those in search of a better life—the tired, the poor, the huddled masses yearning to breathe free.

Trump doesn't get that. https://t.co/g6JoyGaHrb
If those in power don't take action to end our gun violence epidemic, we must vote them out. Period. https://t.co/BVD3V6pYfu
I remember when we had a president our children could look up to. https://t.co/hW5VvXG5vU
I believe our elections should be decided by the American people — not foreign governments.
Let's be clear, President Trump is trying to hijack this election.

This isn’t a Democratic issue or a Republican issue. This is a national issue. https://t.co/me7g8R0h72
It’s been 11 days since @UAW workers started their strike to fight for higher wages, good benefits, and their fair share of the profits. It’s time for GM to come to the bargaining table with a fair offer that ends the strike and gets its workers back on the job. https://t.co/rUYr35qFop
Every American deserves access to quality, affordable health care—regardless of the state they live in.

We can't let President Trump continue to work with states to undermine Medicaid and prevent low-income Americans from accessing health care. https://t.co/G55JpxxJHn
Every day it becomes clearer, the core values of our nation — our very democracy — are at risk with President Trump in the White House.

We must hold Trump accountable. We cannot let him get away with shredding our Constitution.
I want America to be the envy of the world again. https://t.co/C69oPB7PHH
Income inequality is on the rise across the country — made worse by President Trump’s tax cuts for the super-wealthy. We've got to rebuild the middle class and, this time, we’ll make sure everyone comes along. https://t.co/8aqkJJKkwg
We have a President who believes there is no limit to his power, who believes he can do anything and get away with it, and who believes he is above the law.

This isn’t a Democratic issue or a Republican issue. This is a national issue.
If I am elected President, I guarantee you I will protect your family's health care as if it were my own. Because it's personal. https://t.co/rkH4V5sVP1
Enjoyed sitting down with @jimmykimmel to talk about what’s at stake in this election and the urgent need to make Donald Trump a one-term president.

Tune in to @JimmyKimmelLive tonight! https://t.co/P3zjYBGOIk
Donald Trump pressured Ukraine to manufacture a smear against a domestic political opponent — the “transcript” made that clear. It’s an abuse of power that violates the oath of office and undermines our democracy.

Congress must hold him accountable.
Across the country, health care premiums are rising because of President Trump. His attempts to tear down Obamacare have rattled the insurance marketplace and driven up costs for hardworking Americans. It's unacceptable. https://t.co/vXNaNKXrYW
President Trump’s travel ban—the Muslim ban—remains one of his most egregious attacks on our core values. Spewing the politics of fear &amp; slandering an entire religious community as complicit in terrorism is wrong &amp; goes against everything we stand for. We must overturn the ban. https://t.co/0aHS6QYcJU
Our president put personal politics above his sacred oath. The House must do its job and hold Donald Trump to account for his abuse of power. I will do mine, making my case for a presidency that will mean real help for those in our country who need it most. https://t.co/NVbk9cnXEx
Inspired by the courage and tenacity of @GretaThunberg. She is right — we cannot fail future generations any longer. We must take urgent, drastic action to address the climate emergency before it’s too late. https://t.co/ye130EAvjh
El derecho al voto es el derecho más sagrado como estadounidense, y depende de nosotros hacer que se escuche nuestra voz en cada elección. Dirígete a https://t.co/Hy8C4mIL2M para registrarte para votar y envíalo a cinco amigos para que también se registren.
President Trump cut outreach programs that help people get health insurance coverage. At every turn, he has sabotaged the ACA and made it harder for Americans to access health care. It's wrong.

I'll protect and build on Obamacare to ensure everyone receives the care they need. https://t.co/cqpSDxQeOm
Pressuring the leader of another nation to investigate a political opponent — to help win an election — is not the conduct of an American President. https://t.co/XlaHbHxCMI
President Trump's actions are an abuse of power. They undermine our national security. They violate the oath of office. If we allow a President to get away with shredding the United States Constitution — that will last forever.
The right to vote is the most sacred American right there is — and it’s up to all of us to make our voices heard in every election. Head to https://t.co/Hy8C4mIL2M to register to vote and then send it to five friends to get them registered. #NationalVoterRegistrationDay
Obamacare was, and is, a big deal. It covered 20 million additional Americans and protects over 100 million people with pre-existing conditions. We can't let President Trump and congressional Republicans tear it down.

I’ve seen firsthand how hard America’s teachers and support staff work with little support and few resources. They deserve better. I’m proud to support Chicago’s educators as they fight for fair wages, full staffing, and smaller class sizes.

President Trump and congressional Republicans will stop at nothing to repeal Obamacare. We’ve seen how close they’ve come—just one vote away. We can’t give them another chance.

I'll protect and build on Obamacare to ensure everyone has access to quality, affordable health care. https://t.co/uI8eOeFLpX
Republicans should never have allowed the 1994 ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines to expire.

As president, I’ll take on the @NRA once again to ban these weapons of war and get them off our streets.
Tonight, you made history, @theebillyporter. And as you did it, you reminded us that there is so much more that unites us than divides us. You blazed a trail that will mean so much to so many young people who can now imagine themselves standing on that stage because of you.
It’s time we start rewarding work, not just wealth. America's workers deserve better. I’m proud to stand in solidarity with @UAW. https://t.co/QgN1792VQq
I’m running for president to restore the backbone of this country — the middle class. And this time, everyone is going to come along.
We must take action to end the gun violence epidemic. Enough is enough. https://t.co/ShgTkAuZag
Let’s be clear, Donald Trump pressured a foreign government to interfere in our elections. It goes against everything the United States stands for.

We must make him a one-term president.
Today, I proudly stood alongside @UAW members on strike in Kansas City as they fight for a fair contract. Everything that defines a middle class life is because of unions fighting for worker protections. I stand with you, and America stands with you. https://t.co/5tejdcZXnJ

I’m even more optimistic about the future of our country than I was as a 29-year-old in the Senate. We are the United States of America — together, there is nothing we can’t do. https://t.co/I7hmPFVeIx
America was built by hard-working, ordinary people doing extraordinary things. It’s time we start rewarding work, not just wealth.
https://t.co/lLcF9p7mGa
Desperate Donald Trump knows that I can beat him, so now he’s enlisting the help of a foreign government — once again. It’s an abuse of power and violates every basic norm of the presidency.

We cannot give him four more years in the White House.

There's a lot at steak in this election. #SteakFry https://t.co/GTKxYoqo5C
Not a joke, #TeamJoe is strong in Iowa. #SteakFry https://t.co/JQISaemexx
Stopped by #BidenFest to thank folks for their support before today's #SteakFry! https://t.co/sGzr0RQVBU
Eight. That’s how many times Donald Trump asked a foreign leader to investigate me and my family.

Why? Because he knows I'll beat him like a drum. https://t.co/Oc303alcBi
It's wrong what GM is doing to its workers — they deserve better. I'm proud to stand in solidarity with @UAW members on strike as they fight for fair wages, good benefits, and their hard-earned share of the profits. https://t.co/bBqVSDxxv5
Happy Homecoming, Delaware State University! I’m biased, but you are the greatest HBCU in the country.
Today is a day to celebrate Armenia’s democratic progress and to honor Armenia’s history. That history is not complete unless we recognize, once and for all, the Metz Yeghern—the Armenian Genocide. https://t.co/240N5ZXLLB
Before tonight's #LGBTQforum in Iowa, I shared why I believe everybody deserves to be treated with dignity and respect under the law — regardless of who they are or whom they love. https://t.co/h53usuqLA9
LGBTQ rights are the civil rights issue of our time. For all the hard-won progress made in the fight for equality, and for as much as we can celebrate how much better things have gotten, this fight is not over. I’m proud to stand by those who fight for it every day. https://t.co/UTYvDoLD1R
Today, I am back in the Hawkeye State, discussing the issues that impact the lives of LGBTQ Americans at the #IowaForum. Tune in live: https://t.co/vm5coaATNc
If these reports are true, then there is truly no bottom to President Trump’s willingness to abuse his power and abase our country. https://t.co/PblNGDarXU
Today, we remember and honor our nation's prisoners of war and those still missing in action. We have an obligation to fulfill our national promise to our military service members and their families to bring all our heroes home. You are not forgotten. #POWMIARecognitionDay https://t.co/qMVRUZJgtX
Last Friday, on the 25th anniversary of VAWA, @DrBiden delivered a powerful message and reminded us that there’s so much more to do. Thank you to @UNHSHARPP for the important work you do every day to support women at UNH. https://t.co/bCfSLFyi1M
Hace dos años, el huracán María tocó tierra en Puerto Rico, devastando la isla y robando la vida de miles. En ese momento en que nuestros compatriotas necesitaron más ayuda, el presidente Trump les falló. https://t.co/wue61t3SdP
Inspired by the courage and determination of young people across the world as they take to the streets for today’s #ClimateStrike. Climate change is an existential threat that we cannot wait to address. It's up to all of us to take action—future generations are counting on us.
From Universal Pre-K to fighting for raising the minimum wage, @BilldeBlasio has a record of taking on the important issues we face as a nation. Thank you for running a campaign focused on lifting up working families. https://t.co/to6SRwbOXQ

Our students deserve better than four more years of Donald Trump and Betsy DeVos.
We started @ItsOnUs with the goal of ending the epidemic of sexual violence on our college campuses. I’m proud of the progress we’ve made, but we have further to go. As we celebrate #5YearsOfItsOnUs, we must recommit to rooting out the toxic culture once and for all. https://t.co/ya72SOIYVp
Wealthy special interests and corporations have dominated our politics for far too long.

It’s time we overturn Citizens United and create a public financing system for our elections.
Siempre estuve orgulloso de servir junto al presidente Obama, pero nunca más que cuando aprobamos la Ley del Cuidado de Salud a Bajo Costo. Como presidente, protegeré y ampliaré Obamacare para garantizar que cada estadounidense reciba la atención médica que merece. https://t.co/a47rIpNP8P
I was proud to serve alongside President Obama every day, but never more so than when we passed the Affordable Care Act.

As president, I’ll protect and build on Obamacare to ensure every American receives the health care they deserve: https://t.co/34NCSYhO2C https://t.co/HBa1Ewy6tb
South Carolina is one of only five states without a hate crime law. But this week, @SteveBenjaminSC and the Columbia City Council stood up and declared that hatred and bigotry have no place in their city. https://t.co/KGqomC7Wvn
Jill and I are heartbroken at the passing of Dr. Emily Clyburn. She was a remarkable woman — an activist and community leader, a true partner throughout Jim's career in public office. Jim and the entire Clyburn family are in our hearts during this time of grief. https://t.co/1DXYCSLgG1
It’s past time we ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. We must get these weapons of war out of our communities. https://t.co/yTQ4SvqIAR
I’m more optimistic about America’s future today than I was when I was first elected to the Senate as a 29-year-old kid. There’s not a single thing we cannot do — if we do it together.
We need a president who believes in science over fiction. As president, I will fight for rigorous fuel economy standards that protect our health, our environment, and our economy.
Donald Trump continues his relentless effort to roll back the hard-fought progress we made in the Obama-Biden Administration. Higher auto emission standards make the air we all breathe cleaner, keep us healthier—and keep our auto industry competitive in the global marketplace. https://t.co/G2scIizq53
When domestic abusers have easy access to guns, the result can be fatal. Gov. Sununu should work with the NH legislature to keep guns out of the hands of abusers. 

I wrote &amp; passed the Violence Against Women Act. I’ve taken on the NRA twice — and as president, I’ll do it again.
Another school year is starting. Another month of Senate Republicans’ inaction on gun violence. This powerful ad from my friends @sandyhook captures the physical and emotional consequences of that inaction. https://t.co/16jaVm4QNG
When I talk about our gun violence epidemic, I’m not only talking about the tragic mass shootings that make national news. I’m also talking about the shootings that occur every day in communities across the nation like Wilmington, Delaware.

We must take on the @NRA and end this. https://t.co/O7hq93Jdyf
No one should be fired simply because of who they are or who they love. We must pass the Equality Act and ensure LGBTQ Americans are treated with the dignity and respect they deserve.
I can promise you that no one will work harder to earn the support of every Amtrak employee. https://t.co/H7YupBImgi

Grateful for all the support at last night’s Galivants Ferry Stump in South Carolina! It’s time we get up, come together as a nation, and lead the world once again. Because there’s not a single thing we cannot do together. https://t.co/JEoXLGXDWP
Our firefighters and teachers should not be paying a higher tax rate than someone making $50 million a year.

We’ve got to repeal President Trump’s tax cuts for the super-wealthy and create a tax code that works for the middle class.
This afternoon, I’m joining @PhillyAFLCIO at the #Workers2020 Summit to discuss how a Biden administration will rebuild America’s middle class and strengthen the right to organize and collectively bargain. Tune in: https://t.co/9C0dDa9HZ2
Cokie Roberts was a pioneer. Relentless in her pursuit of the truth and steadfast in her commitment to breaking down barriers for women in journalism—our country is better because of it. @DrBiden and I send our prayers to her loved ones at this time. https://t.co/ARA804negW
Thank you, South Carolina, for a great evening at the Galivants Ferry Stump. As I discussed last night, we’ve got to rebuild America’s middle class. That starts with repealing President Trump’s tax cuts for the super-wealthy and rewarding work — not just wealth. https://t.co/ISrYut1BGO
It’s always good to be back at the Galivants Ferry Stump! https://t.co/5Aq57vMzgk
259 days into 2019.

300 mass shootings.

We cannot go on like this.
America’s farmers continue to pay the price for President Trump’s reckless trade war. He thinks he’s being tough, but it’s easy to act tough when someone else is feeling the pain.

As president, I’ll stand up to China and help working families. https://t.co/UHhCVLetKD
It is only with persistent effort, fortitude in our actions, and faith in ourselves and the future that change comes. It’s never easy. But I know there’s nothing we can’t accomplish if we stand together as Americans. https://t.co/oivMtCiSJ8
Hate only hides, it doesn't go away. We have not relegated white supremacy and racism to the pages of history. But the greatness of this nation has always been, and must continue to be, that we still strive to. https://t.co/lvwgQLuRfg
Being a nation of immigrants is one of America's greatest strengths. It doesn't matter where your family comes from — we're bound by the same ideals and made up of the same grit and determination to succeed. https://t.co/wskp3AL5cb
We have not relegated racism and white supremacy to the pages of history. Lynch mobs, arsonists, bomb makers, and lone gunmen. We must give hate no safe harbor. https://t.co/YnyO7V4u0G
Los Estados Unidos es una idea que se ha fortalecido a través de las contribuciones únicas de la comunidad hispana. ¿Dónde estaríamos sin la juez Sonia Sotomayor, César Chávez, @HildaSolis, Dolores Huerta y otros que han mejorado nuestro mundo? #HerenciaHispana

Obamacare fue un gran avance: proporcionó protecciones a más de 100 millones de estadounidenses con afecciones preexistentes. No podemos parar allí. Como presidente protegeré y expandiré Obamacare para garantizar que todos tengamos acceso a atención médica asequible y de calidad.
Obamacare was a huge step forward—providing protections to over 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions. We can’t stop there. As president, I’ll protect &amp; build on Obamacare to ensure every American has the peace of mind that comes with quality, affordable health care.
My North Star as president will be rebuilding the backbone of this country — the middle class. And this time, we'll make sure everyone comes along.
Debemos hacer todo lo que esté a nuestro alcance para abordar la emergencia climática. Como presidente, trabajaré para convertirnos en una economía de energía limpia con emisiones netas cero para el 2050. Volveremos a liderar el mundo en la lucha contra el cambio climático.
We must do everything in our power to address the climate emergency. As president, I’ll put America on course to become a 100% clean energy economy with net-zero emissions by 2050. We will lead the world in the fight against climate change once again. https://t.co/Wkc6eSZY8z
I’m running for president because we are in a battle for the soul of this nation. It’s time for us to pick our heads up and remember who we are — this is the United States of America. There’s not a single thing we can’t do.
25 years ago this week, Senator Feinstein and I led the charge to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. We beat the @NRA and got it done.

As president, I’ll do it once again. We will get these military-style weapons off our streets. https://t.co/VeF6tP1H2K
25 years ago, the Violence Against Women Act was signed into law, forever changing the culture around sexual assault and domestic violence in our nation. It's one of my proudest accomplishments.

There's still more work to be done—and it's on all of us to finish the job. #VAWA25 https://t.co/skyMifaxqv
I’ve learned that the way you deal with loss is by finding purpose — purpose in what you do. #DemDebate https://t.co/TCfXXL4TwM
Nothing about VAWA was easy or uncontroversial. It took four years from when I first introduced the bill in 1990 until it passed.

At last night’s #DemDebate, I discussed my vision for the country and how I'll deliver tangible progress on the most pressing issues facing working families.

I refuse to postpone American possibilities any longer. There’s enormous opportunity once we get rid of Donald Trump. https://t.co/eBmbdUEpYX
I just stepped off the #DemDebate stage, where I laid out why I’m the only candidate who can take big progressive policies and create tangible results for working families.

If you liked what you heard, help us keep this momentum going by pitching in: https://t.co/btrAlw3PSA
That’s all we have for tonight, folks! Thanks for following along. Make sure to follow @TeamJoe to stay up-to-date on what’s happening on the campaign. #DemDebate
We need a president who can deliver progress on the most pressing issues facing Americans. Joe Biden will be that president. #DemDebate
There was only one candidate onstage who has the experience—from Scranton, PA, to the White House—to hit the ground running as President. And that candidate is Joe Biden. #DemDebate
There was only one candidate onstage who helped create—and then signed—a Pledge for Election Integrity, promising to use no disinformation or tolerate outside interference in the election or our democracy. #DemDebate
There was only one candidate onstage who stood at President Obama’s side to lead a nation out of a recession and put middle-class Americans back to work. #DemDebate
There was only one candidate onstage who has flipped a Senator's vote to help pass once-in-a-century health care reform. #DemDebate
Ten candidates took the stage tonight. But there was only one candidate onstage who has defeated the NRA twice and passed an assault weapons ban. #DemDebate
It could take 10 years before we get to Medicare for All. We can't wait — people need help now and hope now. #DemDebate https://t.co/o3G1DENRR4
K-12 education isn’t enough. Many parents don’t have access to early educational resources for their kids. A Biden administration will provide Universal Pre-K, to help ensure that no child’s future is determined by their zip code, parents’ income, race, or disability. #DemDebate
We must invest in resources that support our students' physical and emotional health. A Biden administration will double the number of psychologists, counselors, nurses, social workers, and other health professionals in our schools. #DemDebate https://t.co/bXqEBbiYnc
There will be no better advocates in the White House for our students and educators than Joe and Jill Biden.

Read our full plan for educators, students, and our future: https://t.co/d1o4WnUNrt

#DemDebate https://t.co/ygmktBYbEy
Throughout his career, Joe Biden has:

Fought redlining.

Fought school lines drawn to keep races &amp; classes separate.

Fought to put public housing in white neighborhoods.

Fought for more resources to prosecute hate crimes.

#DemDebate
It’s important to have a plan that meets the urgency of this climate crisis. But it’s going to take more than plans—it’s going to take leadership. Biden has the relationships with key foreign leaders and the experience to get this done. #DemDebate
Joe Biden knows how to rally the world to meet the climate crisis because he’s done it before. Biden worked alongside President Obama to get the world—including China—to agree to the Paris Accord; and he will be prepared on day one of his presidency to push beyond those goals.
It's past time to end the war in Afghanistan. Joe Biden has long believed that we should narrow our focus to counter-terrorism operations. We can't keep spending tens of billions of dollars every year to sustain a stalemate. #DemDebate
If we don't write the rules to protect American labor and the environment, China will—and not in a way that advances our values. When it comes to trade, we've got to work with allies—not against them. #DemDebate
For a socialist, Senator Sanders has a lot of confidence in corporate America. #DemDebate https://t.co/J3gnqHrv4X
The Obama-Biden Administration did NOT prosecute asylum seekers, or those coming here in search of opportunity. #DemDebate
The Obama-Biden Administration did NOT terrorize families and indiscriminately target people who had lived here for years. #DemDebate
The Obama-Biden Administration did not conduct workplace raids—in fact, it ended them. #DemDebate
Attempts to compare President Trump and President Obama on immigration are far-fetched. #DemDebate
After people serve their time, they should have an opportunity to earn a good life and contribute to our country.

Joe’s plan will help give treatment, job training and education opportunities to people both during and after incarceration. #DemDebate https://t.co/aJEaNV0Rgm
We are tearing communities apart through mass incarceration. That's why the Biden administration would reform the criminal justice system by:

✅ Reducing our prison population
✅ Eliminating racial disparities
✅ Making our communities safer

There’s enormous opportunity once we get rid of Donald Trump. #DemDebate https://t.co/gkt6fq4Bvh
Senator Sanders' Medicare for All plan would require raising taxes on the middle class.

Joe Biden:
There will be a deductible—in your paycheck.

#DemDebate
Senator Sanders thinks corporations will give the money they would have spent on health care back to their workers. #DemDebate

Joe Biden: https://t.co/CmnXUZZOc2
I know the Senator said she's for Bernie. I'm for Barack.

#DemDebate https://t.co/PgloBlDka1
90% of Democrats support protecting and building on Obamacare with a public option like Medicare. #DemDebate https://t.co/2bJKZYS0Xl
Senators Sanders and Warren would put an end to the employer-sponsored and union-negotiated plans that more than 100 million Americans currently have.

That's a non-starter for us.

#DemDebate
Let’s get the facts straight: Medicare for All will cost 30x more than Joe Biden’s health care plan—and it will be paid for in part by raising taxes on the middle class. #DemDebate https://t.co/1NOJcXFFVs
Hey everyone — @TeamJoe here! We’re taking over to keep you updated on all the things happening at tonight’s #DemDebate. Make sure to follow along and cheer on Joe! https://t.co/hhhkT86OxT
Ready. #DemDebate https://t.co/GJXM4QRHd9
Helplessly watching your child deal with a life or death condition is one of the worst things a parent can go through. Jill and I are so glad to hear Sadie is doing well, @Bakari_Sellers, and our prayers are with your family as she recovers. https://t.co/A1K3yPUpkO
President Trump’s decision to take billions from the military to build his wall is an unabashed abuse of power. It endangers the American people and forfeits investments in our future, security, and children — all to score political points. https://t.co/CeQr87Oxcv
The Trump Administration is denying Temporary Protected Status to Bahamians escaping the devastation of Hurricane Dorian. It’s heartless and goes against everything we stand for as a nation.

The cruelty of this administration truly knows no bounds. https://t.co/e56k78Rpda
Barack Obama was a great president. We don’t say that enough. https://t.co/FLiYpg8jLR
Beth James is strong, courageous, and resilient. Her story is the story of millions of women all across this country. It’s why I worked so hard to pass the Violence Against Women Act — and it’s why I’m committed to changing the toxic culture that still pervades our society today. https://t.co/gisDYqUDsQ
All workers deserve the right to bargain for good wages, benefits and working conditions—including gig workers. That is why I'm pleased the CA Legislature passed AB5. As president, I will enact a federal law to ensure gig workers get the full protections they deserve.
Each 9/11, we remember that resilience and courage live in the hearts of all Americans—especially our brave first responders. 18 years later, we reaffirm that Americans will never bend to terrorism, and we will never forget those we lost.
La fuerza de los Estados Unidos está y siempre ha estado arraigada en nuestra diversidad. Los inmigrantes siempre nos han hecho más fuertes. Donald Trump no entiende eso.
America’s strength is and has always been rooted in our diversity. Immigrants have always made us stronger. Donald Trump doesn’t get that.
Puerto Rico aún se está recuperando de la devastación del huracán María. Ahora, en lugar de apoyar la reconstrucción, Trump está desviando $400 millones de dólares para su construir su muro que estaban planificados para proyectos militares en Puerto Rico. Es inaceptable.
Puerto Rico is still rebuilding from the devastation of Hurricane Maria. Now, instead of supporting the recovery, President Trump is defunding $400 million in planned military projects in Puerto Rico to build his wall. It's unacceptable.
JoAnne, the good news is the bad news: you won the contest, and you're coming to Houston with me. Grateful for JoAnne's support and that of our incredible supporters. https://t.co/MalsrJMocw
South Carolina lawmakers are rushing through an extreme law that is a direct violation of a woman’s constitutional right to choose. It’s wrong, it’s dangerous, and we must fight it. This decision should remain between a woman and her doctor. https://t.co/MR1CTmA3rY
20 million people gained coverage under Obamacare. But after countless attacks on the law by the Trump Administration, the uninsured rate increased for the first time since 2010 — leaving an additional 1.9 million people uninsured.

As president, I'll defend and build on the ACA. https://t.co/qsbjQIDYhf
There is no distinction between mental health and physical health — it’s health. On #WorldSuicidePreventionDay, we must recommit to eliminating the stigma around mental health and ensuring everyone has access to the care they need.
It’s Election Day in #NC09 — grab a friend and get out and vote for @McCreadyForNC. Polls are open until 7:30 PM, and you can find your polling place here: https://t.co/ZP5Ummu2Jw
I support @McCreadyForNC because of his honorable service to our nation &amp; because of his values: he'll fight to protect North Carolinian’s health care &amp; take on prescription drug companies.

If his opponent has his way, 44,000 people in #NC09 stand to lose their health coverage.
We’ve got to choose science over fantasy — and that starts with getting rid of this administration. https://t.co/WBNfsLIF80
Every American deserves to retire with dignity. But today, too many people — especially older Americans — cannot afford their prescription drugs. I sat down with AARP to discuss how I’ll stand up to the abuse of power by drug corporations and lower costs for Americans. https://t.co/5v7JmFze5b
I’m still fired up from the incredible energy at the #NHDems2020 convention. Thank you to everyone from @TeamJoe who came out to show your support! https://t.co/TEJCpZLX9v
Hurricane Dorian devastated the Bahamas, leaving nearly 70,000 people homeless. It’s our moral responsibility to do everything we can to help Bahamians — not turn them away.

This isn’t who we are. https://t.co/RLRAVHo1Od
With Congress back in session, passing gun safety legislation should be the first order of business. It’s past time for Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans to stand up to the @NRA and take concrete action to end our gun violence epidemic. https://t.co/S8GSiYmrVe
Young Americans are especially worried about climate change and know it is not just a domestic priority — it's a foreign policy one. I agree. And I'm ready to tackle this on day one. https://t.co/evUnnqUCoS https://t.co/vMgLVZlv5R
I’m inspired by John and grateful for his support. My message to him is clear: never give up and never let it define you. https://t.co/y7Lo8whWOa
Mexico isn’t paying for the wall.
American military families are.
 
China isn’t paying for the tariffs.
American farmers and manufacturers are.
 
The American people continue to foot the bill for President Trump’s senseless political games.
The deadliest mass shootings all have one thing in common: assault weapons.

It’s past time we get these weapons of war off our streets. I’ve banned them before, and I’ll ban them again in the White House. https://t.co/iyKWqhyIIz
As president, I’ll invest in our K-12 schools to eliminate the funding gap between majority white and non-white districts, and rich and poor districts. No child’s future should be determined by their zip code, parents’ income, or race. https://t.co/hHruW4f2BZ
Obamacare prohibits insurers from denying coverage for the 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions.

President Trump wants to gut the ACA and tear that protection away. We can’t forget that.
It's time we reward work, not just wealth. https://t.co/5VHINGqBxu
The @TeamJoe energy outside of the #NHDems2020 convention was incredible! https://t.co/rIeRpyyqZD

Thank you to everyone who joined us in Laconia and New Castle. As I discussed this evening, we’ve got to do everything in our power to end this gun violence epidemic. That starts with passing universal background checks and banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. https://t.co/4MR5KuQrDd
Las políticas de inmigración del presidente Trump son un asalto a la dignidad humana y todo lo que representamos como nación. Por esto hay que acabar con ellas. https://t.co/otwGtLfHyM
President Trump’s immigration policies are an assault on human dignity and everything we stand for as a nation. We must end them. https://t.co/otwGtLfHyM
This is the United States of America. There is not a single thing we have not been able to accomplish once we set our minds to it.

Together, we can and will meet the challenge of this climate emergency. https://t.co/tiLZIyMRgQ
The Iran Deal put Iran's nuclear program in a box. Trump walked away from the deal, and now Iran is advancing its program. This is another reminder that Trump's manufactured crisis is making the U.S., the region, and our world less safe. https://t.co/KXD7Bdb5kU
The fight against cancer is personal for me — like it is for so many Americans. It’s why I’m committed to ending cancer as we know it. https://t.co/NAsBNU0j6l
America has stood as a beacon of hope for generations. Now, President Trump wants to slam the door in the face of those fleeing persecution. It's cruel and damages our global standing.

I'll ensure we meet our responsibility as a nation to the world's most vulnerable people. https://t.co/KjBkGlBPpu
We all have a responsibility to stand up and speak out when we see abuse of power. Silence is complicity. https://t.co/y03WGsYigi
President Trump stokes the flames of hatred, coddles white nationalists with messages of support, and preys on our deepest divisions. If we give him four more years in the White House, he will forever alter the character of our nation.

We can’t let that happen.
I always enjoy sitting down to chat with my friend @StephenAtHome. Check out a few of my favorite moments from the interview. https://t.co/723faRbi6A
President Trump is dead wrong on climate change. We’ve got to choose science over fantasy and treat it like the existential threat that it is.

As president, I would rally the world to take unprecedented action. There would be no empty chair at the G-7. https://t.co/QvLCIM39oV
Hace dos años, el presidente Trump intentó terminar con DACA, obligando a nuestros DREAMers a vivir con miedo y caos. Es cruel.

Los soñadores son estadounidenses. Es hora de que el Congreso cumpla con nuestra promesa y les proporcione un camino hacia la ciudadanía.
Two years ago, President Trump attempted to end DACA—throwing lives into chaos &amp; forcing our DREAMers to live in fear as the Supreme Court decides their fate. It's cruel.
 
DREAMers are Americans. It's time for Congress to keep our promise to them &amp; provide a path to citizenship.
Despite what the @NRA says, the assault weapons ban that @SenFeinstein and I championed worked. It saved lives.
 
I’ll ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines once again. We will get these weapons of war off our streets. https://t.co/KpXXPzjYjJ
Last night, @StephenAtHome asked me what the defining factor was in my decision to run for president. My answer was clear: Charlottesville. https://t.co/NN335Bxsvk

It’s critical to have a plan to combat climate change, but it’s going to take more than plans — it’s going to take leadership. I have the experience and relationships necessary to rally the world to meet the urgency of this climate crisis. #ClimateTownHall https://t.co/aXvhwUDHMq
That’s all we have for tonight’s CNN #ClimateTownHall! Make sure to follow @TeamJoe to stay up-to-date on everything happening on the campaign.
Joe Biden grounded his plan in the science — in what the world’s leading climatologists and the UN tells us we need to achieve. It provides a comprehensive path forward on how to address the most pressing issue of our time. https://t.co/evUnnqUCoS
Under Joe Biden’s plan for a clean energy revolution and environmental justice, we will: 

✅ Achieve a 100% clean energy economy and net-zero emissions by 2050
✅ Rejoin the #ParisAgreement on day one and rally the world to go further
✅ Stand up to polluters

#ClimateTownHall https://t.co/7UP1GoZYUv
Climate change is an urgent threat to our environment, health, economy, and national security. There’s no time for on-the-job training. We need a leader who is ready on day one — and that’s Joe Biden. #ClimateTownHall
The clean energy economy of the future presents an enormous opportunity. President Biden will create 10 million well-paying jobs in the United States that will grow a stronger, more inclusive middle class in communities across the country. #ClimateTownHall
The Green New Deal is a crucial framework for meeting the climate challenges we face. It powerfully captures two core truths:

1️⃣ This is an existential crisis requiring immediate, ambitious action.
2️⃣ Our environment and economy are connected.

#ClimateTownHall
If Joe Biden was president, there would be no empty chair at the G-7. #ClimateTownHall
We can't turn a blind eye to the way in which environmental burdens are distributed unevenly along racial and socioeconomic lines.

Biden will right these wrongs and stand up to fossil fuel companies  who disproportionately harm communities of color and low-income communities.
Here’s the deal: Joe Biden introduced one of the first climate change bills in the Senate, and he’s been at the forefront of the fight ever since.

Don’t just take our word for it, @PolitiFact called Joe Biden a climate change pioneer. #ClimateTownHall

https://t.co/xti5vounyv
On day one as president, Joe Biden will take action to put the United States on track to achieve a 100% clean energy economy and net-zero emissions no later than 2050

Because action on climate change can’t wait. #ClimateTownHall https://t.co/YWw0tFodt2
Hey everyone — @TeamJoe here! We’re taking over for tonight’s CNN #ClimateTownHall. We’ll keep you updated as Joe Biden takes the stage to discuss his plans to combat climate change.
Tune in to the @colbertlateshow tonight at 11:35 PM ET! https://t.co/tkNbnttzMF
For too long, partisan gerrymandering has allowed politicians to rig the political process and draw districts in their favor. Voters should choose their representatives — not the other way around. https://t.co/RrJvJMcNyR

Say thank you—because these are the people who make America run. Not the Wall Street bankers. Not the CEOs or hedge fund managers. Ordinary people doing extraordinary things.
Say thank you to the people who build our roads and bridges. Keep our water systems working. Teach our kids and take care of the sick among us. Race into our burning buildings. Grow our food, build our cars, and pick up the garbage off our streets.
This Labor Day, when you cross paths with someone working a job that makes your day-to-day life better—and I promise you, it will happen many times today—tell them thank you.
 
Tell them you appreciate the work that they do. That it matters to you, and to your community.
This Labor Day, we celebrate the battles waged and victories won by organized labor. Unions built the great American middle class, and it’s time we recognize that.

I promise you if I’m elected president, unions will have no stronger champion in the White House. https://t.co/u8kcyq5zBg
Together, we will beat the @NRA. We will end this gun violence epidemic.
It has been 186 days since the House passed the bipartisan universal background check bill. 
 
@Senatemajldr Mitch McConnell and the Senate should pass it immediately.
 
Lives are at stake.
Les Gelb was a giant of American foreign policy, and several generations of thinkers and policy makers owe their success to Les' mentorship and intellectual generosity. @DrBiden and I send our deepest condolences to Judy, Adam, Caroline, Alison and all his grandchildren.
I’m heartbroken, sickened, &amp; angry. Weeks after the horror in El Paso, another community in Texas has been terrorized by gun violence. Enough. We must end this epidemic.

@DrBiden &amp; I send our thoughts to those affected &amp; thank our law enforcement who responded at great risk.
Obamacare covered 20 million additional Americans, protects over 100 million with pre-existing conditions, and allows young adults to stay on their parents’ coverage until age 26.

We can’t afford to tear it down and start over. We should protect and build on it.
On Thursday, 10-year-old Marcus asked me an important question about President Trump. https://t.co/AJeUAXW5ST
Like all bullies, President Trump is trying to make himself seem stronger by picking on the most vulnerable among us — but I would have thought even he would understand that kids with cancer were off-limits.
 
He is morally unfit to lead this country.

@GovernorBullock Thanks for the recommendation, @GovernorBullock! I’d love to try it next time I’m in Decorah.

I can’t believe I have to say this: We should not deport children seeking treatment in the U.S. for life-threatening illnesses. https://t.co/7ng4vwHHKg
Esta no es solo una campaña para vencer a Donald Trump - es un movimiento basado en los valores que definen nuestra nación: la honestidad, la decencia, y el tratar a todos con dignidad y respeto, mientras le damos la espalda al odio. Eso es lo que somos como estadounidenses.
This can’t just be a campaign to beat Donald Trump. This has to be a movement grounded in the values and ideals that define our nation best: honesty, decency, treating everyone with dignity and respect, and giving hate no safe harbor.

That’s who we are as Americans.
Como tantos otros han dicho, la crueldad es su meta. Es su única meta, y es lo único que tienen para postularse: el miedo, la ira, la división y la crueldad. Debemos restaurar el alma de nuestra nación.
No hay justificación para traumatizar aún más a los niños enfermos en sus momentos más vulnerables. Como todo abusón, Trump está acosando a los más débiles, pero atacar a niños con cáncer y fibrosis quística es intolerable.
No sabemos ya qué decir para condenar la inhumanidad de esta administración que arranca niños de los brazos de sus padres y acosa a las familias en sus vecindarios. Ahora deportará a niños que están recibiendo tratamientos de vida o muerte por afecciones graves.
President Trump has found his newest target — sick children. It's sinful. https://t.co/dgFT0vNbYC
Grateful to everyone who attended our town hall at Clinton College. As I discussed this morning, we need to stand up to President Trump’s constant attacks on immigrants and end his inhumane policies. We’re stronger because of our diversity — not in spite of it. https://t.co/yo7IxNVI3K
If we give Donald Trump four more years in the White House, the planet may never recover. https://t.co/h2N0hn6k6L
Hello, Clinton College! https://t.co/luc3BkRo3M
It wasn't a setup, I swear. https://t.co/j3lpThTrWh
As so many others have said, cruelty is their point. It is their only point, and it’s all they have to run on: fear, anger, division, and cruelty. We must restore the soul of our nation.
There is no national security justification for further traumatizing sick kids at their most vulnerable. Like all bullies, Trump is purposefully targeting the little guys—but I would have thought even he would understand that kids with cancer and cystic fibrosis were off-limits.
We are running out of words to condemn the inhumanity of this administration. An administration that pulls children from the arms of their parents and stalks families in their neighborhoods will now deport children who are in life-saving treatment for dire conditions like cancer.
Our military families sacrifice everything in service to our nation. And today, the Trump Administration revoked automatic citizenship for some of their children.
 
It's reprehensible and cruel. As president, I'll reverse it immediately. https://t.co/WgizSndgMF
Wrapped up our day at Limestone College. I enjoyed hearing from students about the need to reform our criminal justice system and get assault weapons off our streets. I know with these young folks at the helm, America's best days still lie ahead. https://t.co/nJYx1zzlsJ

56 years ago, the March on Washington and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s “I Have a Dream” speech changed the course of history.

When it comes to meeting the existential crisis of our time, Trump has walked away from the table — literally. If we give Trump four more years, the planet may never recover from his utter disregard for the climate crisis and scientific fact.
The distance Trump has put between the U.S. and the rest of the world on the issues that matter most to Americans couldn't be more clear. There is no more telling metaphor for this administration's abdication of American leadership than the empty chair at the G-7 climate meeting.
After three days, we have even more evidence of how President Trump's disastrous foreign policy has left the U.S. isolated. Rather than looking to America for vision, our closest democratic allies sought to manage and mitigate the damage Trump might do at this year's G-7.

America was built on a simple proposition: all men — and women — are created equal. We haven't lived up to that promise for most, but haven't stopped trying. As we celebrate the 19th Amendment and #WomensEqualityDay, we must continue our fight to truly achieve equality for all.

The U.S. stood with the Baltic States during the Soviet occupation—their flags always flew in D.C., affirming America's defense of democratic values. Today, we must stand with the people of Hong Kong &amp; ensure the U.S. remains a beacon of hope to people around the world.
30 years ago, 2 million people joined hands to form the Baltic Way—a chain of human determination that reached across Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania in defiance of Soviet oppression. It was—and remains—a powerful demonstration of the irrepressible desire for freedom.
Today, demonstrators in Hong Kong, inspired by the iconic Baltic Way protest, formed a human chain to demand China live up to its promises to the people of Hong Kong. They once more showed the world the common yearning for liberty that unites us all.
It was great to be back with folks at Dartmouth College today for our Health Care Town Hall.

Every day President Trump proves how morally unfit he is to sit in the Oval Office. A president should bring out our best as Americans — not echo schoolyard bullies with taunts based on physical appearance.
https://t.co/TKfog6NMNz
I look forward to joining @GiffordsCourage and @AMarch4OurLives at their forum to discuss how we can take on the @NRA and end our gun violence epidemic. Together, we will get it done.
It was great meeting our previous contest winners, Kellie and her wife Amanda, after last month’s Democratic debate.

Enter now for your chance to join us for the next debate in Houston: https://t.co/hgKmqF00yn https://t.co/BK6mCgFjkR
We are in a battle for the soul of this nation. If we want to win, it’s going to take everyone stepping up, speaking out, and taking action.

A Biden administration will ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. We will get these military-style weapons off our streets.
Coal miners have powered our country from the Industrial Revolution to the 21st century. I'm proud to stand with the protesting miners. Blackjewel has an obligation to give its workers the pay and benefits they’ve earned. https://t.co/juuDvLWnKZ
Since 1978, CEO compensation has risen 940%, while the average American has seen a raise of just 12%. It’s wrong. We need a $15 minimum wage, stronger labor laws, and a tax code that works for the middle class.

It’s time we reward work, not just wealth. https://t.co/E1rJPpGdsy
Gov. @Hickenlooper ran a strong campaign, talking about the urgent need to rebuild our middle class and standing up to President Trump's trade wars. Coloradans are lucky to have John in their corner, and I look forward to seeing what he does next.
I have always been a stalwart supporter of Israel—a vital partner that shares our democratic values. No democracy should deny entry to visitors based on the content of their ideas—even ideas they strongly object to. And no leader of the free world should encourage them to do so.
Before I was Vice President, before I was a Senator — I started my career as an elected official on the New Castle County Council. Local races matter. I'm proud to sign the @runforsomething pledge to support candidates up and down the ballot to invest in our party’s future.
Rep. Steve King should resign. His comments on rape and incest have no place in Congress and fuel a corrosive culture in this country around sexual assault.

We deserve better from our elected officials. https://t.co/QRXM3nUP8s
.@DrBiden and I send our prayers to the police officers injured today in Philadelphia, and to their families who wake up every day knowing that their loved ones are walking into harm's way when they put on the badge. We're grateful for the selfless work they do to keep us safe. https://t.co/0G4h7QcTrc
America is an idea. An idea that for centuries has offered hope to the tired, the poor, and the huddled masses yearning to breathe free. 

We won’t let Donald Trump and his administration change that. https://t.co/HMjXf0ak2A
Whether you are online, at a gun show, or in a store — you should have to pass a background check to buy a gun. Period. https://t.co/npb6VFvwlu
President Trump has emboldened white nationalists with messages of support, called Mexicans rapists, and told members of Congress to go back to where they came from.

The words of a president matter. And Trump has used his to unleash the deepest, darkest forces in our nation.
This is America, and we are strong and great because of our diversity — not in spite of it. Donald Trump doesn’t get that.

Prioritizing wealthy immigrants while punishing working-class ones betrays the American idea that everyone gets a fair shot — regardless of background. https://t.co/NY0gYKbm9L
The brave protestors in Hong Kong are demanding the rights and freedoms promised to them. The U.S. should be leading the free world to rally support behind them and, with one voice, defend our shared democratic ideals and the desire for liberty that beats in every heart.
Don’t tell Champ and Major. https://t.co/ld8ZdYTKQC
The vast majority of Americans want common-sense gun safety reform. We need leaders with the backbone to stand up to the @NRA and get it done. https://t.co/h65U60V8Rx
For decades, the Endangered Species Act has protected our most vulnerable wildlife from extinction. Now, President Trump wants to throw it all away.
 
At a time when climate change is pushing our planet to the brink, we should strengthen protections — not weaken them. https://t.co/64O12QaWwM
If we cannot rise to meet this moment, it won’t just be a political failure. It will be a moral one. It will mean that we accept the next inevitable tragedy.

We cannot allow that to happen. We must end our gun violence epidemic. https://t.co/LmiZkk2NDT
There used to be a basic bargain in this country that when you worked hard, you were able to share in the prosperity you helped create.

That bargain is broken for American workers, and it's time we restore it. https://t.co/1X8OtXQ3lb
Two years after Charlottesville, we have a problem with this rising tide of white supremacy in America. And we have a president who encourages and emboldens it. But if we stand together in opposing it, we will win the battle for the soul of this nation. https://t.co/7X6nSZMyQT
As president, I will do everything in my power to stop America’s gun violence epidemic by passing common-sense gun reform. Lives depend on it.
https://t.co/1oGyLME1fk
.@DrBiden and I wish everyone celebrating #EidAlAdha hope, faith, and joy. Eid Mubarak!
In the Senate, @SenFeinstein and I led the successful effort to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. It worked. It saved lives.

As president, I’ll take on the @NRA and ban military-style weapons once again.
https://t.co/bPPJXCdQWt
We need universal background checks for gun sales. Period. 

I’ve beaten the @NRA twice, and I’ll do it again as president. It’s time for a leader who stands up to the powerful gun lobby.
https://t.co/Yp35AQoLaS
The words of a president matter. Hateful rhetoric and white nationalism have no place in our nation. 
https://t.co/BaBW0SvB5c
Thank you to @Everytown and @MomsDemand for hosting today’s #GunSenseForum.

As I said this afternoon, spread the faith. Talk with friends and neighbors about what's happening in America. Demand change. Because together, we can and will end our gun violence epidemic. https://t.co/rqAgETgQsw
Assault weapons don’t belong in our communities. Period. As president, I’ll ban these military-style weapons and institute a buyback program that gets as many as possible off our streets. https://t.co/25ie9qBiSC
July was the hottest month on Earth ever recorded — making it clearer than ever that climate change is already here and requires our urgent, drastic action.

On day one, I’ll take the bold action necessary to tackle this crisis head-on. https://t.co/QLfgtL32Y6
Now is not the time to cower in the face of the @NRA, now is the time to stand up with courage and conviction and pass gun safety legislation. Lives depend on it.
There’s no better place than the Iowa State Fair to meet some new folks and stop for ice cream. Thank you to everyone who said hello! https://t.co/8kllm7Y3P7
We are in a battle for the soul of this nation. But I know — with passionate folks like those at last night’s @iowawingding — we will win. https://t.co/UZZR6qv8kd
Grateful for the hard work these folks put in every day on the ground in Iowa. #WingDing https://t.co/8jw98yBbCB
We need gun safety reform &amp; leaders who will step up to get it done. Gov. Sununu instead has decided to stand with President Trump in putting the gun lobby over common-sense reforms that will keep Granite Staters safe.

As president, I’ll take on the NRA &amp; win—again. #NHPolitics
Five years ago, Michael Brown's life was taken in Ferguson. His death stirred the conscience of our nation and awakened a generation of activists. We must ensure justice rings out for all in America — regardless of skin color.
At moments when we have been tested most, American presidents have stepped up.

We don’t have that today. We have a president who has aligned himself with the darkest forces in this nation. And that makes winning the battle for the soul of this nation that much harder. https://t.co/7BFSGSUkCu
Assault weapons and high-capacity magazines don’t belong on our streets.
.@DrBiden and I had a great afternoon at the Iowa State Fair where we talked with folks about our bold vision for the country. I stopped for some ice cream, too. https://t.co/khHEdnMTOh
In the Senate, I successfully took on the @NRA to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines — and helped pass the Brady background check bill. As president, I’ll do it again.

Add your name to stand with me: https://t.co/o8CBlezjAd https://t.co/VG2NjjTnKr
This is who Donald Trump is: a president determined to terrorize immigrant communities and rip apart families — at the border and across our country.

The question is, who are we? I believe we are a nation that will end these cruel policies and make Trump a one-term president. https://t.co/u7DA2Fnr5l
Along with Senator Feinstein, I got assault weapons and high-capacity magazines banned in this country for ten years. As president, I’ll make sure they’re banned once again. https://t.co/2NrD4JIRT3
On a day when President Trump is supposed to be embracing a grieving community and celebrating our American diversity in El Paso, his administration is instead stoking fear by conducting massive immigration raids in Mississippi.

He is morally unfit to lead this country. https://t.co/R7q41zefPu
The @NRA doesn’t own this country. We the people own this country.
In both clear language and in code, President Trump has fanned the flames of white supremacy in this nation. https://t.co/UoiiMVrCW7
We are in a battle for the soul of this nation. It’s why I’m running for president. https://t.co/XgVOF7Xt8q
We are almost 330 million Americans who have to do what our president can’t. Stand together. Stand against hate. Stand up for what—at our best—this nation believes. https://t.co/Sj4Zio4Zbd
We are almost 330 million Americans who have to do what our president can’t. Stand together. Stand against hate. Stand up for what—at our best—this nation believes.

If we stand together, we will win the battle for the soul of this nation.
So it’s up to us. We’re living through a rare moment in this nation’s history. Where our president isn’t up to the moment. Where our president lacks the moral authority to lead. Where our president has more in common with George Wallace than George Washington.
Trump offers no moral leadership, no interest in unifying the nation, and no evidence the presidency has awakened his conscience in the least.

Instead, we have a president with a toxic tongue who has unapologetically embraced a political strategy of hate, racism, and division.
At moments when we have been tested most, American presidents have stepped up. They led, opposed hate, and chose to fight for the best of the American character.

We don’t have that today. Our president has aligned himself with the darkest forces in this nation.
The honest truth is both elements are part of the American character. At our best, the American ideal wins out. But it’s never a rout. It’s always a fight. And the battle is never finished.
I wish I could say this hate began with Trump and will end with him. It didn’t &amp; it won’t.

The battle for the soul of this nation has been a constant push-and-pull between the American ideal that we are all created equal &amp; the harsh reality that racism has long torn us apart.
In both clear language and in code, this president has fanned the flames of white supremacy in this nation.
How far is it from the white supremacists and Neo-Nazis in Charlottesville – Trump’s “very fine people” – chanting “You will not replace us” to the shooter at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh saying Jews “were committing genocide to his people.”

Not far at all.
How far is it from Trump’s saying this “is an invasion” to the shooter in El Paso declaring “this attack is a response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas”?

Not far at all.
I said at the time that we were in a battle for the soul of this nation. I said it again when I announced. It’s why I’m running for president.
When he said after Charlottesville that there were “very fine people on both sides” he gave license and safe harbor for hate to white supremacists, Neo-Nazis, and the KKK.

Those words stunned the nation and shocked the world.
The words of a president matter. They can move markets. They can send our brave men and women to war. They can bring peace.

And they can unleash the deepest, darkest forces in this nation — like Donald Trump has chosen to do.
WATCH LIVE: Joe Biden Speaks in Burlington, Iowa https://t.co/rq8PO3XtMP
A president is supposed to unite our nation and lift us up. Not prey on our divisions and tear us down. https://t.co/qde3e7Y9wX
Yesterday, @DrBiden and I had the opportunity to thank a few firefighters for their dedication to keeping Idaho safe.

I’ve witnessed the heroism of first responders—they rush into the face of danger every single day to save complete strangers. They are the best of America. https://t.co/BZGCgzEL6P
Toni Morrison had an incredible ability to translate the everyday experience of African Americans into written word. Her writing had the power to open minds, shift political discourse, and shape the views of generations. She will be sorely missed. https://t.co/lj8M2y1zwR
Fred, your strength and resilience in the face of unspeakable tragedy continues to inspire me and so many others. I carry Jaime’s memory with me every day as we continue our efforts to end America’s gun violence epidemic. https://t.co/D4tbmT2UNI
But our job is not done. The #VotingRightsAct has been gutted by the Supreme Court &amp; voting rights are under siege across the country.

As president, I will restore the VRA, stand up to attacks on the right to vote, &amp; renew our efforts to ensure every American’s voice is equal.
The fight for civil rights is one of the things that got me engaged in politics. And when I was ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, we successfully extended the #VotingRightsAct for 25 years.
54 years ago, the #VotingRightsAct brought our nation closer to living up to our founding ideals of equality, equity, and fairness for all. https://t.co/JsFPLhBYHO
We can’t fix a problem if we refuse to name the problem. This is white nationalism. This is white supremacy. This is about hate.

Mr. President, it’s long past time you stood up to it. https://t.co/EI0YakZYlA
Thoughts and prayers won’t solve our broken gun laws. We need politicians with the courage to stand up to the powerful gun lobby and tell them that they don’t own this country.

I’ve beaten the @NRA twice, and I’ll do it again in the White House.
Honesty, decency, hope, leaving nobody behind, giving hate no safe harbor. That’s who we are. But I don't see much of that coming from this administration. https://t.co/fkRcGfJgXW
As we watched in horror at the events in El Paso and Dayton, Chicago suffered its most violent weekend of 2019.

We cannot go on like this. We must muster up the courage to take on the @NRA, pass common-sense reform, and end our gun violence epidemic. 
https://t.co/0eUEzzUCQJ
Let's be very clear. You use the office of the presidency to encourage and embolden white supremacy. You use words like infestation and invasion to talk about human beings. We won't truly speak with one voice against hatred until your voice is no longer in the White House. https://t.co/CW3wxxTm2E
Mr. President, immigration isn’t the problem. White nationalism is the problem. America’s inaction on gun safety legislation is the problem.

It’s time to put the politics aside and pass universal background checks and an assault weapons ban. Lives depend on it. https://t.co/zGFDUZyihw
Enough is enough. As a nation, we need to take common-sense steps to end this epidemic of gun violence.

@senatemajldr Mitch McConnell should reconvene the Senate and pass the House’s universal background check bill. We cannot wait to take action. https://t.co/0OLqH0xxcl
We can’t fix a problem if we refuse to name it: white nationalism. An ideology emboldened by a president who stokes the flames of hatred and coddles white supremacists with messages of support.

We must do what Trump won't: condemn this evil and eradicate it from our society.
We are in a battle for the soul of this nation. And in this moment, we all have a responsibility to declare with conviction that hatred and bigotry and white supremacy have no place in America. We will give hate no safe harbor.
We have to address what’s happening in America. We continue to bear witness to acts of terror carried out with a common thread: hatred of “the other.” We saw it in Charlottesville two years ago, at synagogues in Pittsburgh and Poway, and now in El Paso.
Assault weapons and high-capacity magazines don’t belong on our streets. We must stand up to the @NRA and gun manufacturers—they don’t own this country. We the people own this country.
At least 29 lives stolen, families broken, communities shattered in El Paso and Dayton within 13 hours. Dozens more wounded. Between those two mass shootings, dozens more were killed and injured by gun violence that didn't make national headlines.
Heartbroken to hear the news from El Paso. Our thoughts are with those impacted by yet another senseless act of gun violence in America.

How many lives must be cut short? How many communities must be torn apart? It’s past time we take action and end our gun violence epidemic.
It’s clear that climate change is already here. Today. And we need to take urgent action to address it.

That starts with beating Donald Trump. https://t.co/G5m7S6jpPS
In the last three years, President Trump has turned our world upside down internationally and economically. People are hurting. The soul of our country is collapsing because of his presidency.

We have to be honest, straight forward, and authentic about what we will do to fix it.
America must defend the values that unite us—we must lead the Free World. 

As president, I will remind the world who we are. The United States does not coddle dictators. The United States stands up for democracy.
Donald Trump is echoing his authoritarian heroes, again—this time using China's anti-democracy talking points to describe the peaceful protests in Hong Kong as riots. It's shameful.

When people suffering under oppression look to the U.S. for hope, Trump has nothing to offer.
Yet more proof that Trump doesn’t care about the farmers, workers, and consumers that are being crushed by his irresponsible tariff war with China. It’s easy to act tough when someone else is feeling the pain.

I will reverse his senseless policies.
https://t.co/8XrVcUjUB5
There is nothing moderate about what President Obama did with Obamacare. Nothing. Seven presidents tried to expand access to health care — the Obama-Biden Administration finally got it done. https://t.co/awe0f8r0H7
I was surprised at all of the attacks on President Obama's record at the #DemDebate. The Obama-Biden Administration passed Obamacare, lead the world on combating climate change, and saved our economy from the brink of disaster.

He was a great president. We don’t say that enough.
We are a nation of immigrants — that’s why we’re so special. #DemDebate https://t.co/IvM8DOOuzq
The U.S. has a responsibility to extend Temporary Protected Status to Venezuelans fleeing desperate circumstances—violence, oppression, starvation. The House passed a bipartisan bill to take action, now @senatemajldr Mitch McConnell must bring it up for a vote. #TPS4VZ
Wrapped up our time in Detroit with a quick stop at Coney Island Restaurant for some lunch and great conversation with community members. https://t.co/ZRxoCsTP5Q
The criticism of Obamacare is a bunch of malarkey. #DemDebate https://t.co/dS6LDmTBOH
The ACLU says that the Trump Administration has continued to rip children from their parents, even after courts ordered them to stop. It’s inhumane &amp; goes against everything we stand for as a nation of immigrants &amp; values.

I’ll end these cruel policies.

Mr. President — this is America. We are strong and great because of our diversity. #DemDebate https://t.co/XjveDSBJ0T

We can protect our interests in Afghanistan, including the possibility of a terrorist threat re-emerging, without a large troop presence. That is what Joe Biden will do as president. https://t.co/5viTYUtn3l
Joe Biden has long believed that the US should narrow rather than broaden its military efforts in Afghanistan, and has for years advocated for ending the war responsibly. We can't keep spending tens of billions of dollars a year to sustain a stalemate.
#DemDebate
Joe Biden believes that women have a constitutional right to choose. Roe v. Wade is the law of the land, and Biden will work to codify it. He’ll continue to fight for a woman’s right to make her own health care decisions with her doctor.
#DemDebate
Finally, Joe Biden has been integral to some of the biggest child care tax credit wins in our history, including in the Recovery Act and the fiscal cliff deal.

And as president, he'll expand the child care tax credit to up to $8,000 per family.
#DemDebate
Here's the truth about Joe Biden's vote:

He wasn't opposed to the child care tax credit itself. He was opposed to this specific tax credit being made available to affluent people.
This attack from Senator Gillibrand has been two weeks in the making, and it STILL isn’t accurate. Let's set the record straight:
Vice President Biden has fought for women's rights his whole career:

✓Wrote the Violence Against Women Act
✓Co-sponsored the Equal Rights Amendment 9 times
✓Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act: 1st Obama-Biden bill signed into law 
✓Co-sponsored the Pregnancy Discrimination Act
When it comes to trade, either we're going to write the rules of the road for the world or China is—and not in a way that advances our values. 

Meanwhile, this administration has launched trade wars against the very allies we need with us to change China’s behavior.
#DemDebate
Biden will stand up to the abuse of power by polluters who disproportionately harm communities of color and low-income communities. He’ll work to ensure that communities across the country from Flint, MI to Harlan, KY to the NH Seacoast have access to clean, safe drinking water.
Joe Biden has received more than 100 endorsements from community leaders around the country, including Detroit's own @MayorMikeDuggan.

In 2009, the Obama-Biden administration made a big bet on rescuing the US auto industry. It paid off:

-Auto production doubled in the US
-Auto sales hit an all-time high

Detroit was on the front lines of that recovery.

Under Medicare for All, Americans will see a new type of deductible in their paycheck. Medicare for All costs $30 trillion. Not sure what math they do in New York or California but that would be a lot of money. https://t.co/ifctf8g7pB
Las políticas de inmigración de Trump son un asalto a la dignidad humana. No somos un país que niegue a los niños jabón y cepillo de dientes. Esto no es lo que somos. #DemDebate
Trump's immigration policies are an assault on human dignity. We aren't a country that denies children soap and a toothbrush. This is not who we are. #DemDebate
Donald Trump is the problem with our immigration policy. He's using family separation as a weapon against desperate people seeking safety and a better life.

We need to defeat Donald Trump. #DemDebate
Let’s get the facts straight: Medicare for All will cost 30x more than Joe Biden’s health care plan—and it will be paid for by raising taxes on the middle class. #DemDebate https://t.co/dlyVfenQFg
Because of the Affordable Care Act, 20 million Americans gained health insurance. Millions more gained critical protections. But the work isn’t over. As president, Biden won’t rest until everyone has access to the quality, affordable care they deserve. #DemDebate
As Vice President, Biden was a champion for efforts to implement the federal mental health parity law, improve access to mental health care, and eliminate the stigma. 

As president, he'll enforce our mental health parity laws and expand funding for mental health services.
Senator Harris’ Medicare for All plan still gets rid of employer-sponsored coverage and still costs 30x more than Joe Biden’s health care plan. Just changing the start date by 6 years doesn’t change the fact it is bad policy. #DemDebate https://t.co/CsBtsTevWE
I’m running for president to restore the soul of this country...No one man has the capacity to rip that apart. It’s too strong. We're too good. https://t.co/qUDRRuY5Rg
Americans prefer protecting and building on Obamacare with a public option over Medicare for All: https://t.co/tNlPVLG1v8
Healthcare is the most important issue to Americans. Senator Harris won't be able to beat Trump with double-talk on healthcare.
We have a plan that builds on the ACA by giving Americans more choice, reducing health care costs, and making our health care system easier to navigate.
Mr. President, this is America. We're stronger because of this diversity, not in spite of it. #DemDebate

Hey everyone, @TeamJoe here! We’re taking over for tonight’s #DemDebate to give you the facts about Joe’s record on the issues and vision for our country. Stay tuned!
Now I’m handing the account over to my team before I take the stage. They’ll keep you up-to-date on what’s happening at tonight’s #DemDebate. Make sure to follow along!
We deserve leaders that unite us around our shared goals, rather than prey on our divisions. That’s why I’m running for president. To unite our country and put us on a different path — not back to a past that never was — but to a future that fulfills our true potential.
Detroit — and our country as a whole — is like its people: resilient and tough. Defined by a work ethic that is unmatched by any place in the world. And when given half a fighting chance, there’s nothing the American people can’t do.
As we gather in Detroit, it’s important that we recognize the significance of the Motor City. Because few cities embody the American spirit better than Detroit.

When it was knocked down flat on its back, it didn’t give up. It came roaring back.
Tonight, I’ll take the stage in Detroit for the second #DemDebate. I’m excited to have the opportunity to discuss the issues on voters’ minds, why I’m running for president, and my bold vision for the future of our country.
I'm getting ready to take the stage in Detroit! Grateful to have my family by my side. https://t.co/fMe99KYAIK

President Trump &amp; Betsy DeVos continue to roll back our progress on LGBTQ rights. No child should feel unsafe in school because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

President Trump has failed on his promises for American workers time and time again. We need to rebuild the middle class, and this time make sure everybody comes along — regardless of race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or disability. https://t.co/Df7rHBCzLp
Two years ago, President Trump gave giant tax cuts to the super-wealthy and corporations. Now, he wants to rip free school lunches away from kids who need help the most. It’s heartless. No kid should go hungry in America. https://t.co/TybdVnFjLH
We have a moral obligation to do everything in our power to stop America’s gun violence epidemic — that starts with taking on the powerful gun lobby and passing common-sense gun safety laws.

I’ve beaten the @NRA twice. And I’ll do it again in the White House.
The Affordable Care Act changed the life of @DrBiden’s sister — like it did millions of Americans — by giving her access to the health care she needed. We can’t afford to start over. https://t.co/ixdpu8bQGv
.@TheRevAl is a champion in the fight for civil rights. The fact that President Trump continues to use the power of the presidency to unleash racist attacks on the people he serves is despicable. This hate has no place in our country. It's beneath the dignity of the office.
Iowa, I have some big news: @DrBiden is heading your way on August 1st to open two of our field offices. Join her in Sioux City: https://t.co/h1olJlsQuc or Council Bluffs: https://t.co/1PoR8mdfT2. https://t.co/79BfOWQrIh
We’re gathering #TeamJoe in Detroit on July 30th and 31st to show the power of our grassroots movement at the second debate. I hope to see you there! RSVP at  https://t.co/9dh6RvZ9bO.
This violence is not normal. How many more families will have to lose a loved one before we fix our broken gun laws? We must take action, starting with real reform.

Our thoughts are with everyone in Gilroy this evening. Enough is enough. https://t.co/wHqY9RE8Nu
Instead of starting from scratch, we need to build on the Affordable Care Act. I'll expand on the progress we made—giving Americans more choice, reducing health care costs, and making our health care system less complex to navigate.

Far too often, students who experience mental health problems do not get the care they need. As President, I will double the number of mental health professionals in schools to give our kids the support they deserve.
https://t.co/hHruW4wDtx
We need to show the power of our grassroots movement. If you’re in the Detroit area, come together with #TeamJoe in your community outside of the second debate on July 30 and 31. RSVP at https://t.co/9dh6RvZ9bO.
Congratulations to our @TeamJoe #DemDebate contest winner—Kellie from North Carolina!

Can’t wait to see you at the debate in Detroit on July 31st, Kel! https://t.co/MmJ4Ye8VqR
I worked hard to pass the Affordable Care Act—it was a milestone for American health care. I will continue to oppose every effort to tear it down. We have come too far to start over. Read my plan to protect and build on Obamacare at https://t.co/gm6jgUINzt
.@RepCummings is one of the finest people I’ve ever served with. It is despicable for you to attack him and the people of Baltimore this way. Once again you have proved yourself unfit to hold the office. A President is supposed to lift this nation up. Not tear it down.
Here’s the deal: I will oppose every effort by Republicans, Democrats, &amp; anyone else seeking to tear down Obamacare. It is imperative that we build upon the progress we've made by protecting the Affordable Care Act. Read my plan at https://t.co/IwFG48ED9h 
https://t.co/BaLX1VRWZo
A border wall is the physical embodiment of @realDonaldTrump’s inability to develop effective immigration policy.

His use of Department of Defense funds for the wall is a phony answer to the real challenges we face—and he knows it. https://t.co/JAhysdhNd8
Climate change is an existential threat to our planet. As President, not only will I recommit us to the Paris Agreement—I’ll lead an effort for every major emitting country to ramp up the ambition of their domestic climate targets. 
https://t.co/1aKhXI1FPY
As president, I’ll make it a priority to take action against polluters who knowingly harm our environment and poison our communities’ air, land, and water. Read my plan at https://t.co/FbsOsyQkIo
We can't be blind to the way environmental burdens—like air pollution—are distributed unevenly along racial and socioeconomic lines. https://t.co/74pGl6etPp
Today, on the Act's anniversary, we must recommit to fully breaking down barriers so everyone has the opportunity to succeed—no matter their zip code, income, race, or disability. As president, I'll ensure everyone's treated with dignity and respect. https://t.co/OwVUoUSQ7B
Growing up with a stutter, my parents taught me from a young age that being different is no barrier to success. Instead, the barrier is far too often our laws, our institutions, and our culture. The ADA began to change all of that.
I've always been proud to have cosponsored the Americans with Disabilities Act, signed into law 29 years ago. Thanks to the vision &amp; persistence of @SenatorHarkin &amp; many disability leaders, this bill was a critical step in the fight for equal rights for people with disabilities.
Earlier this week, @DrBiden,@RepRichmond, and I had the opportunity to spend some time with the great folks at @YEPNOLA in New Orleans, Louisiana. It was great getting to see the work they’re doing to inspire the children in their community. https://t.co/hubDMkr8bm
Trump is fighting tooth &amp; nail to deny those fleeing dangerous situations their right to seek asylum in our nation. We should uphold our moral responsibility &amp; enforce our immigration laws with dignity—not turn away those fleeing violence, war, &amp; poverty. 
https://t.co/1CVPP3sJo3
Trump’s tariff war with China is crushing American farmers. It's easy to talk tough when someone else feels the pain. We need to be tough AND smart—working with allies to curb China’s abusive trade practices, not isolating us from our closest partners. https://t.co/pY75vyEFn3
Let's call Trump’s travel ban what it is: a disgrace. We are a nation of immigrants, and we need a leader who recognizes that our diversity is our greatest asset. https://t.co/YLkEI4xHb2
Because a union fought for their private health insurance plan, Marcy and her husband were able to retire with dignity and respect. That’s why my plan to protect and build on Obamacare will give folks the option to choose what’s best for them.
Like so many other Americans, Marcy prefers to keep her private insurance while recognizing that a public health insurance option is necessary for some of her friends and family. https://t.co/1PnfSGC5WC
Since 1973, over 160 individuals in this country have been sentenced to death and were later exonerated. Because we can’t ensure that we get these cases right every time, we must eliminate the death penalty. 
https://t.co/o9LQHWwmt7
Had the opportunity to discuss my plans to advance equity and opportunity for communities of color all across the nation today at the @NatUrbanLeague Conference in Indianapolis. Thank you for having me! https://t.co/m7s2Mjw671
Governor @RicardoRossello’s resignation is a testament to the power of everyday people to effect change and a critical opportunity for Puerto Rico, which has been battered by natural disasters and corrupt governments for far too long. #PuertoRicoSeLevanta
The black agenda is America’s agenda. This morning, I discussed my plans for communities of color on the @TJMShow.

https://t.co/Q07kNyGp2J
Here’s the deal: health care is a right. Every American should have the peace of mind that comes from  access to affordable health care, and we can get there by protecting and building on Obamacare.

Denali's death marks the 3rd murder of a trans woman in South Carolina this year.

Violence against the transgender community is an epidemic—crimes are occurring far too often. It's our moral obligation to put an end to violence in our communities. 

https://t.co/cW4gRobK3M
Russia undermined our democracy by interfering in the 2016 election. That's a fact. We need a President who will stand up to the Kremlin, push back against Putin, and take immediate steps to ensure the security of our elections.
One of the great things about being on the trail is getting a chance to have lunch with great folks like @MayorMikeDuggan and community leaders in Dearborn. https://t.co/gIrUARzmYN
As President, I will provide states with funds to shift from incarceration to prevention, including addressing factors correlated with incarceration like illiteracy and child abuse. 

Read our plan: https://t.co/FWDpncAAaI https://t.co/YPQHMJ36Im
Thank you, @NAACP, for hosting a thoughtful discussion in Detroit. As I shared today, there’s nothing we can’t do if given half a chance. https://t.co/F1U6wjnxoG
I believe in redemption. Formerly incarcerated individuals deserve the opportunity to be productive members of society. I’ll expand access to mental health &amp; substance use treatment, education, job training, and housing. 

Read our plan: https://t.co/FWDpnciYM8 https://t.co/ShIE1GsEun
Certain life experiences are strongly correlated with an increased likelihood of future incarceration - abuse, illiteracy, experience in foster care.

I’ll invest in our children to address underlying factors driving incarceration. Read our plan at https://t.co/fsdoT4QPAb https://t.co/bYYmWTCA4V
It’s about time we start rewarding workers with the resources to live with dignity &amp; respect—that begins with better wages and benefits, and the right to collectively organize and strike.
Today, I stand with @unitehere airline catering workers as they rally together at DCA. #1Job
I had the opportunity to visit @YEPNOLA in New Orleans, Louisiana with @RepRichmond today. I commend the work they’re doing to ensure bright futures for the children in their community. https://t.co/YeJeHDDThq
We currently have insufficient data to eliminate racial &amp; ethnic biases in our criminal justice system. As president, I’ll urge states to add info regarding ethnicity to their data collection to understand how groups—like Latinx—interact with the system. https://t.co/fsdoT4QPAb
We must reform our juvenile justice system to give children a second chance to live up to their potential. My plan will invest in juvenile justice programs, protect juvenile records, &amp; end the use of detention as punishment for status offenses. Our plan: https://t.co/FWDpnciYM8 https://t.co/n1lCcuirS0
My plan will counter the rise in hate crimes &amp; reinvigorate community-oriented policing in order to root out persistent crime and hold violent offenders accountable. Read our plan at https://t.co/fsdoT58qYL. https://t.co/WbypZ7iguW
The Equifax settlement is a reminder of the trust we put in major corporations that possess large amounts of personal data. We must continue to hold them accountable for keeping personal information secure and protected.  
https://t.co/uTuS3SJQ9Q
Today I released my plan to reform our criminal justice system. 

Equality, equity, justice—these ideas form the American creed. We have never lived up to it and we haven’t always gotten it right, but we’ve never stopped trying. Learn more about my plan at https://t.co/fsdoT58qYL https://t.co/qAJoFa5CqN
Too many people are incarcerated in the US – and many don’t have resources to successfully rejoin society after serving their time.

That’s why I’m releasing my plan to reduce our prison population, create a more just society, &amp; make our communities safer. https://t.co/bnXs8L6bnP https://t.co/it7JtZ0OjS
Trump’s words and actions are damaging our place in the world and our futures. We are a nation founded on diversity and opportunity for everyone. 

I’m running for President because we need to fight back against the incredible abuses of power we’re seeing.
https://t.co/YNdTZMlqeP
Trump’s continued racist attacks against these members of Congress cannot be tolerated or excused. This is not who we are. We must hold him accountable for his words.
Drug corporations are profiteering off the pocketbooks of sick individuals.

Under a Biden administration, we’ll put a stop to runaway drug pricing so every American has the peace of mind that they can afford their medication. https://t.co/xaRm1RVsh2
Americans work hard every day, and they deserve a worry-free retirement with a steady income. I’ll put Social Security on a path to long-run solvency through a tax on the wealthiest wage earners. Learn more about my plan for Older Americans at https://t.co/HtXrkNMdlV.
9 years ago today, I proudly stood alongside President Obama as he signed the Wall Street reform and consumer protection bill into law. 

In the midst of the financial crisis we inherited, we fought to protect working Americans from predatory practices and prevent another crash.
I was never more proud to serve as Vice President than on the day President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act. As president, I’ll protect the progress we’ve made and build on Obamacare to ensure every American receives quality, affordable health care. https://t.co/FocwDh7Rqv
Ended my trip to Nevada by participating in a @nvdems Local Brews and National Views. Thank you to all who attended, it was a pleasure spending time with you! https://t.co/RwTA55NgLb
Every American deserves the peace of mind that comes with quality, affordable health care.

My new plan will allow people to buy into a public option, increase premium tax credits for middle class families, and expand coverage to low-income Americans. https://t.co/64JECAyTKu
Happy #NationalIceCreamDay! I hope everyone enjoys some ice cream on this hot summer day. I’ll be eating a pint of chocolate chip myself. https://t.co/Oi9Sk9D4tE
I know if we come together there is nothing we can’t do. That gives me the strength to know we can defeat Donald Trump and once again put this nation on the path towards dignity and decency and justice. https://t.co/WpJat7FcIV
Today was our first nationwide Day of Action! It was great to spend the day in Las Vegas, Nevada kicking off our phone bank with our incredible volunteers. #TeamJoe https://t.co/kgwJNVLzjN
Seven years ago, our nation watched in horror at the news from Aurora, Colorado. 12 innocent lives, full of so much promise, were cut short in an act of terror. Many more injured and traumatized. Today, we recommit to taking action to reduce gun violence
That's what we're capable of when we come together in service of something larger than ourselves. That's the America I have faith in.
In that moment, we weren't thinking about being Democrats or Republicans. We weren't thinking about a way to contort the nation's victory in favor of one political faction or another. We were, quite simply, Americans—joined together in our wonder, awe, and shared humanity.
Fifty years ago today, in every corner of our country, Americans gathered together to watch our nation put three astronauts on the moon. For a moment, we all held our breath together, knowing we were about to bear witness to a first for mankind.
I’m heading to Detroit at the end of the month for our second Democratic debate. Supporters in every part of the country are coming together on July 31 to have parties to watch the debate. I hope you’ll host one in your community: https://t.co/bZ3kMKnAsd https://t.co/TDKTGrVeTy
This heat wave is a reminder that we’re already feeling the impacts of climate change.. It’s clear we need to take drastic action now to solve our climate crisis and protect the planet for future generations.

Stay safe this weekend. https://t.co/UwNKcKXIWg
I’m running for president to restore the soul of this nation, rebuild its backbone — the middle class, and unify all Americans.

If you’re with me, let me know by committing to vote today: https://t.co/5hv4ZP5LGJ
Los comentarios del gobernador @RicardoRossello son vergonzosos. El lenguaje de odio no debe ser protegido, independientemente del título político. El pueblo de #PuertoRico será escuchado y decidirán quién va a dirigir su gobierno.
Governor @RicardoRossello's comments are shameful. Hateful language should be given no safe harbor -- regardless of political title. The people of #PuertoRico will be heard, and they will decide who leads their government.
It was great meeting so many folks today at Tamales Liliana in Los Angeles. Thank you @HildaSolis for having lunch with me! https://t.co/F2K2I1GOS6
Here's the deal, my plan to build on Obamacare will expand health care coverage and lower costs — without raising taxes on the middle class.

Proponents of Medicare for All can't say the same. https://t.co/V6GxL8MaFI
President Trump’s comments this week were despicable. https://t.co/fOPHDDr1S4
Tomorrow, I’m heading to Nevada for our first Day of Action! Talking with neighbors about what’s at stake in this election is how we’ll win. RSVP to join us in Las Vegas for a phone bank kickoff: https://t.co/xDvumwKVns
In America, health care is a right for all — not a privilege for the wealthy few.

As president, I’ll repeal President Trump’s tax cuts for the super wealthy and close capital gains loopholes to help ensure everyone has access to the care they deserve. https://t.co/URjgZONjmL
.@DrBiden is visiting South Carolina tomorrow, and I’m excited for the folks of Summerville to have the opportunity to meet her! Head to https://t.co/2Yyl5xQcSo to RSVP.
Stopped by Dulan's On Crenshaw to serve some food and chat about why I'm running for president. A great way to start our trip to Los Angeles! https://t.co/K0e8WAVsup
America’s teachers shouldn’t have to work a second job after a full day in the classroom just to make ends meet — but stories like these are all too common. In a Biden administration, we’ll change that by giving our educators the pay they deserve.
https://t.co/2oZSCg9vfo
The ACA was and is a big deal. It took a century of presidents trying to expand health care access, and President Obama and I got it done. We can’t start over.

I’ll fight tooth and nail against anyone who tries to tear it down—Republican or Democrat. https://t.co/kCbETQ5MiD
Rebuilding America’s middle class is the major moral obligation of our time. And today, House Democrats took an important step forward in that fight by passing the #RaiseTheWage Act. It’s past time for a $15 minimum wage and a real pathway to the middle class. https://t.co/mTQ8GrSS7z
This Saturday, our campaign will be hosting a nationwide Day of Action. Supporters across the country will be coming together, organizing communities, and talking with voters about what’s at stake in this election. Join us: https://t.co/QZOk7gXUeP https://t.co/167UaHLkKo
I believe protecting the ACA is the most important thing we can do. It covered 20 million Americans and protects over 100 million with pre-existing conditions. I want to hear how it helped you and your family. Click below to share your #MyACAStory: https://t.co/y7dkPXrxex
Like Mark and Marianne, the lives of millions of Americans depend on the Affordable Care Act. We can’t tear it down. We need to protect and build on Obamacare to ensure every American has the peace of mind that comes with quality, affordable health care. https://t.co/o21UoS0ZzT
Let's make sure he doesn’t get four more years in the White House. If you’re with me, join our campaign and let’s get to work: https://t.co/7pOeAlM5Ee
These members of Congress — children of immigrants, just like so many of us — are an example of exactly what makes America great.
Here's what has always made America great:

Honesty. Decency. Treating everyone with dignity. Demonizing no one — not the poor, the powerless, the immigrant, the other. Giving hate no safe harbor. Understanding that, as Americans, we are part of something bigger than ourselves.
Donald Trump thinks that our nation's great diversity makes us weak — because he has no idea what makes us great.
We’ve heard it before throughout our history, but it has no place in America in 2019.

It’s clear that Donald Trump is trying to divide us by race and gender. It’s immoral. Our children are listening.
Four days ago, the President of the United States suggested that four elected members of Congress, all women of color, ought to go back to the countries from which they came. And every day since he has repeated this ugly, racist refrain.
During Beau’s fight with glioblastoma, we learned about the incredible breakthroughs made in cancer treatment — and those that are right over the horizon. This is a fight we can't postpone. I know — with the power of America’s best minds — we can end cancer as we know it. #GBMDay
Wrapped up our trip with stops in Sioux City and Council Bluffs, where we discussed our new plan to ensure that everyone has access to quality, affordable health care. Thank you for a great few days, Iowa! https://t.co/WQvgHV3P2f
We will provide rural hospitals with the adequate funding and flexibility they need to keep their doors open, double funding for community health centers, and expand the pipeline of rural health care providers.
Rural health care will be a top priority in the Biden administration. Under our plan, rural hospitals won’t be threatened by having to get by on low Medicare reimbursement rates for all.
A Biden administration will help rural communities fully access federal resources and tackle persistent poverty in rural America.
We will pursue a trade policy that works for American farmers, transform our agriculture sector, triple funding for rural broadband, and bring cutting-edge manufacturing jobs to rural America.
My plan recognizes how much rural communities contribute to this nation and how much they’ve been hurt by this president’s damaging policies. We are going to build a pathway to the middle class for rural Americans, in rural America.
Rural communities power our nation. They feed our bodies and fuel our engines. A healthy, vibrant rural America is essential to the success of our country. That’s why I released my plan for rural America: https://t.co/RkAm1wJJcI https://t.co/9Xdg0WduPO
In a Biden administration, we’ll give people the choice to buy into a public option like Medicare. That’s the best way to lower costs and achieve universal coverage.

Read our full plan here: https://t.co/RIhlOd6xBG https://t.co/i117zqACNJ
Justice Stevens was a decent, honorable man who served our country well. He understood that the most important thing about being on the Court is treating people with dignity and respect. I was honored to have known him. @DrBiden and I are sending our prayers to his family.
Had the opportunity to speak with some great folks in Manning, Iowa, today about our new plan to revitalize rural economies. Thank you to everyone who joined us! https://t.co/F2MuPGmGvN
Our Statue of Liberty invites in the tired, the poor, the huddled masses yearning to breathe free. Now President Trump wants to slam the door in the face of children and families fleeing war, poverty, and violence.

It’s cruel. It’s not who we are. https://t.co/luIZlx1UcZ
Summer vacation season has started, but many hardworking Americans like the @ATUComm members currently striking the VTA/TCI aren’t taking a break in their fight for safe working conditions, higher wages, and good benefits. I’m proud to stand with them.
Thank you to Governor Tom Vilsack and @ChristieVilsack for opening up your home for yesterday’s house party. It was a pleasure getting to spend some time with the residents of Waukee, Iowa! https://t.co/A6GC1AEJKf
.@DrBiden and I had a very important meeting with @DrakeUGriff while at Drake University yesterday. https://t.co/CvQrwyggb9
I’m glad to hear Matt is doing well — stories like his remind us of the need to protect and build upon the Affordable Care Act. We can’t afford to start over.

Read our plan here: https://t.co/RIhlOcOWK8 https://t.co/o7kAvkPkbJ
At the #AARPIowaForum, I laid out my plan for older Americans. A Biden administration will lower drug costs, protect &amp; strengthen Medicare &amp; Social Security, &amp; help middle-class families grow their savings—because everyone deserves to retire with dignity.

https://t.co/rYVyCoDOAT https://t.co/0ykyiaehBj
Iowa, I hope you’ll join us this week to hear about our bold vision for the future of our country. Head to https://t.co/7mV8NCg4lJ to find an event in your community.
In a Biden administration, we’ll protect the Affordable Care Act and the progress we’ve made — and won’t rest until every American has the peace of mind that comes with quality, affordable health care.

Read the full plan here: https://t.co/RIhlOcOWK8
In America, health care is a right — not a privilege dependent on your gender, race, sexual orientation, income or zip code. Our plan will address systemic inequities to ensure every American receives the care they need and deserve. https://t.co/JDZPUaLc5i
Our plan will stand up to the abuse of power by prescription drug corporations and take concrete steps to lower drug prices for Americans. Because no one should have to choose between putting food on the table or filling their prescription. https://t.co/fXyUfRDQtd
For too many Americans with insurance, health care costs are still too high. Our plan will not only provide coverage for uninsured Americans, but it will also make health care more affordable for those who have it today. https://t.co/6UbtxSLLxY
We will provide premium-free access to this public option — with the full scope of Medicaid benefits — for people who would otherwise qualify for Medicaid, but were denied access by governors and state legislatures. https://t.co/ek22EQW1it
Our plan will give Americans the choice to buy into a public option like Medicare. That’s the best way to lower costs and achieve universal coverage. https://t.co/BrT8Ya2j6b
I understand the appeal of Medicare for All — but folks supporting it should be clear that it means getting rid of Obamacare. And, I'm not for that.

We should protect and build upon the Affordable Care Act and the progress we’ve made. Not tear it down and start over.
The Affordable Care Act was a historic achievement. 20 million Americans gained coverage. Over 100 million with pre-existing conditions finally got protection. We can’t tear it down.

So today, I’m releasing my plan to Protect &amp; Build on Obamacare: https://t.co/RIhlOcOWK8 https://t.co/laDUcIhRjM
A job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about dignity. It’s about being able to look your child in the eye and say everything is going to be ok. But far too many people today can’t do that.

We’ve got to rebuild America’s middle class and ensure everyone gets a fair shot. https://t.co/3Ahrz2UuHG
America’s strength is and has always been rooted in our diversity. But President Trump continues to spew hateful rhetoric, sow division, and stoke racial tensions for his own political gain.

Let's be clear: Racism and xenophobia have no place in America. https://t.co/Gtcx96uZhd
Thank you to everyone who joined us in Londonderry, New Hampshire, where we discussed our plans to build an inclusive middle class where everyone comes along — regardless of race, gender, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or disability. https://t.co/3BCp1cYhHm
Las redadas de inmigración (ICE) del presidente Trump son inhumanas. Sus tácticas no resuelven nada. No deberíamos estar aterrorizando comunidades y dividiendo familias. Debemos proporcionar un camino hacia la ciudadanía y encontrar una solución duradera.
It’s young people like the @NHYoungDems that give me so much hope and excitement for the future of our country. https://t.co/DcsbEFGpVS
President Trump’s ICE raids are inhumane. His scare tactics solve nothing. We shouldn't be terrorizing communities and splitting up families. We should provide a pathway to citizenship and find a lasting solution.
I’m heartbroken to hear of the passing of Héctor Figueroa. Héctor was a stalwart champion in the fight to ensure every worker receives the respect and dignity they’ve earned. My thoughts are with his family and his loved ones.
Had the opportunity to spend some time with the great residents of Atkinson, New Hampshire, today. Thank you all for the warm welcome into your community! https://t.co/A2HLYUh3Li
As individuals, and as a nation, we have to prove to the world that the United States is prepared to lead—not just with the example of our power, but the power of our example.

I will take decisive steps to renew our core American values and return transparency to our government. https://t.co/A13K4rrAtQ
Had to pull the team over for a quick ice cream stop! This time we’re at Annabelle’s Ice Cream in Portsmouth, NH. https://t.co/hAtX7RN6QR
Thank you to everyone who joined us in Dover, New Hampshire! We had a great time discussing how we will rebuild the backbone of this country — the middle class. https://t.co/cVJyXChtQF
The threat Donald Trump poses to our national security — and to who we are as a country — is so extreme we cannot afford to ignore it. https://t.co/UGP4EN1PMw
We have to champion liberty and democracy, reclaim our credibility, and look with unrelenting optimism and determination toward the future. https://t.co/YCPh3YB0e8
We have to champion liberty and democracy. We have to reclaim our credibility. We have to look with unrelenting optimism and determination toward the future.

Head to https://t.co/Iopa13F7wt to read our full plan.
We must once more harness that power and rally the Free World to meet the challenges facing our world today—and it falls to the United States of America to do it.

No other nation has the capacity. No other nation is built on that idea—that promise. And it’s in our self-interest.
No army on earth can match how the electric idea of liberty passes freely from person to person, jumps borders, transcends languages and cultures—how it can supercharge communities of ordinary citizens into activists and organizers and change agents.
We know that economic security is national security. But there are a lot of communities across this country that are hurting—because we’ve neglected the basics.

We will equip our people to succeed in the global economy with a foreign policy for the middle class. https://t.co/Y8q6TWKXBP
I will invite my fellow democratic leaders to put strengthening democracy back on the global agenda.

We will organize and host, during the first year of my administration, a global Summit for Democracy to renew the spirit and shared purpose of the nations of the Free World. https://t.co/KRSbivKXo5
We have to prove to the world that the United States is prepared to lead—not just with the example of our power, but the power of our example.

To that end, as president, I will take decisive steps to renew our core American values and return transparency to our government. https://t.co/GmhzHmGGzu
We only have one opportunity to reset our democracy after Trump—we have to be prepared to make the most of it.

First, we must repair and reinvigorate our own democracy. https://t.co/02G73Q45dr
The threat Donald Trump poses to our national security, and to who we are as a country, is so extreme we cannot afford to ignore it.

His erratic policies and failures to uphold basic democratic principles have muddied our reputation and our place in the world.
In 2019, foreign policy is domestic policy, and domestic policy is foreign policy. They are a deeply connected set of choices we make about how to advance the American way of life and our vision for the future.
Today in New York City, I laid out my foreign policy vision for America. A vision built on restoring dignified leadership at home and respected leadership on the world stage.

President Trump can avoid talking about climate change all he wants, but it doesn’t change the fact that it is real, is here, and requires our urgent action.

We can't afford four more years of a climate change denier in the White House.

Here’s what I commit to you: I will name a Secretary of Education who is an educator. https://t.co/FC37ZMAKAr
The abuse of a child is one of the most heinous, despicable abuses of power imaginable. It is inexcusably poor judgment for a US Attorney to seek leniency for someone guilty of it. Secretary Acosta should provide his resignation immediately.
We can’t tear down the ACA. We should protect and build on it. In America, health care should be a right—not a privilege.

As president, I’ll do everything in my power to stand up to the attacks on the ACA and expand coverage to ensure everyone has access to the care they need.
The Affordable Care Act was and is a big deal. It covered 20 million more people, protects more than 100 million people with pre-existing conditions, and expanded Medicaid — giving millions of Americans the peace of mind that comes with health insurance.
Today, the Affordable Care Act is back in the courts — putting the health care of millions of Americans at risk. It’s clear some will stop at nothing to sabotage Obamacare and roll back the progress we’ve made. https://t.co/7SEAx4HZrd
Thank you to everyone at our town hall discussion in Charleston, South Carolina, for your thoughtful questions on ending gun violence, combating the opioid epidemic, and ensuring every American has access to quality, affordable health care. https://t.co/Dbabofnq4v
The Democratic Party is lucky to have leaders like Eric, and I look forward to continuing to work with him on the pressing issues facing Americans.
His leadership on the House Intelligence Committee and his influential voice pushing the Trump Administration to secure our elections have helped make clear the stakes for our country in next year's election.
.@EricSwalwell ran a passionate campaign, and I commend him for bringing more attention to the urgent need for gun safety reform in America.
It was the honor of my lifetime to serve with a man who I believe was a great president, a historic figure, and most important to me, a close friend.

He selected me. I’ll take his judgment about my record, my character, and my ability to handle the job over anyone else’s. https://t.co/XoZJhNl6xX

Thank you to @NEAToday for a great discussion this afternoon on how we can work together to create #StrongPublicSchools. I can promise you that @DrBiden and I will be the best partners and fiercest advocates in the White House for America’s educators and students. #NEARA19 https://t.co/kKzTLlunk7

Looking forward to joining @NEAToday to discuss my plan for #StrongPublicSchools.

We just wrapped up a great event in Marshalltown, Iowa. Thank you to everyone who came out to join us on this #FourthOfJuly! https://t.co/z6mHBLcPWQ
Every year on the #FourthOfJuly, presidents, elected leaders, and everyday Americans come together at parades, bbqs, and baseball games to celebrate humankind’s highest ideal — liberty. That’s what we’re celebrating today in Iowa.
Will he offer a robust defense of the democratic values that have always been our strength in times of crisis? We all know the answer to that.

Donald Trump is incapable of celebrating what makes America great because he doesn’t get it.
What will Donald Trump say this evening when he speaks to the nation at an event designed more to stroke his ego than celebrate American ideals? Will he speak to the example America must set to inspire the world?
As I celebrate today with friends &amp; family, I am reflecting on the promise those rebels envisioned 243 years ago. America hasn’t lived up to that promise for most people—but we’ve never stopped trying. We must continue in our pursuit until we achieve equality &amp; liberty for all.
We have to be against his policies that are further entrenching economic inequality in this nation. That are rigging the system against the middle class.

That too is an attack on our democracy, on our liberty.
It’s not enough to be against the way Donald Trump conducts himself — we have to be against the way he assaults the dignity of women, people of color, and immigrants.
We have to take on the inequalities in our system that are causing too many today—in America and around the world—to question their faith in the ability of democracy to deliver for them.

It’s not enough to be for political equality. We have to be for economic fairness as well.
My liberty, depends on yours. Our liberty as a nation rests on our ability to ensure equal access and equal opportunity — not just for our own children, but all our children.
But we must also remember, as JFK put it, that ours is “not the individual liberty of one but the indivisible liberty of all.” Donald Trump doesn’t get that.
America is the heart of the Free World, and we must defend it. That is how the #FourthOfJuly is best honored — by remembering that our Declaration is first and foremost a call to arms, in defense of liberty.
And ever since then, presidents and patriots have gathered together on the Fourth to reflect on the greater meaning of our American experiment.
243 years ago, a group of rebels in Philadelphia pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor to a revolutionary idea, to the self-evident truth that all men — and women — are created equal.
It’s fitting that we’re celebrating Independence Day in Independence, Iowa. Thank you to everyone who said hello at this morning’s #FourthOfJuly parade — it was great to see so many supporters! https://t.co/tEOXY8wLAn
America is an idea — stronger than any army, more powerful than any dictator. It gives hope to the most desperate people on Earth. Instills in us the belief that no matter where you start in life, there's nothing you can't achieve.

That's worth celebrating. Happy #FourthofJuly
Thank you to everyone who came out to our event in Waterloo! RSVP to join us tomorrow in Independence and Marshalltown: https://t.co/PyvclvDFPY https://t.co/oEwfwHez3A
DREAMers—young people who came to the U.S. as children—are Americans. They don’t deserve to sit in limbo as the Supreme Court decides whether President Trump can end the Obama-Biden DACA policy. Congress should act now to give them a path to citizenship. https://t.co/4teULJvgki
South Carolina, I’m heading your way this weekend to talk with you about how we’ll build an inclusive middle class where everyone comes along. Head to https://t.co/ie4M0dWVIR to RSVP for an event in your community.
Rooms of people packed body to body. Kids being held without access to showers or a change of clothes. It’s simply abhorrent.

We all have a moral obligation to keep speaking out until this administration ends these inhumane policies once and for all. https://t.co/KrxqXcHV9p
El Departamento de Comercio anunció que el formulario Censo 2020 no tendrá la pregunta de ciudadanía de Trump. Esto no es solo una victoria para los inmigrantes y latinos, sino para todos los estadounidenses. Todos merecemos ser contados sin temor!

But as we mark the 55th anniversary, we must recognize that the work is not done. Too many Americans still face the sting of systemic racism and discrimination. We must double down on our efforts to root out these evils and ensure America lives up to its promise for all.
It also laid the groundwork for other milestones and freedoms to follow — from the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Because when justice rings out for one group, it rings for all groups in America. We’re all made better.
The Civil Rights Act for the first time made real the possibility of equal access to employment. It outlawed discrimination in public facilities, and it gave the Attorney General of the United States of America the power to enforce the law to combat discrimination.
It took the courage and determination of generations of African Americans who refused to wither in the face of racism and intolerance. Their resolve fundamentally changed the character of our nation for the better.
Today marks 55 years since the signing of the Civil Rights Act — the landmark piece of legislation that brought our nation closer to fulfilling the promise that was made two centuries earlier in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. A promise of equality, equity, and fairness for all.
The Department of Commerce just announced the 2020 Census will not have President Trump’s citizenship question. This is not only a victory for immigrants and Latinos, but for all Americans. Everyone deserves to be counted and have their voices heard without fear.
Luis Alvarez was an American hero—@DrBiden and I are sending our thoughts and prayers to his family.

No one should have to spend their final weeks fighting for the health care and benefits they deserve. We must do better for our 9/11 first responders. https://t.co/UkMAdNFXVI
Make no mistake, this is a modern-day poll tax that overturns the will of Florida voters. It’s unacceptable.
 
We must ensure everyone — including individuals formerly incarcerated for felonies — has the right to make their voices heard at the ballot box. https://t.co/s8dFgr0mVm
One in five students experience mental health problems, but too often they don’t get the care they need. In a Biden administration, we will double the number of mental health professionals in schools to give our kids the support they deserve. https://t.co/tGh2Rgd9MX
Income inequality is on the rise — made worse by the Trump tax cut that was a giant giveaway to the super-wealthy. We’ve got to rebuild the backbone of this country — the middle class.
 
That starts by rewarding work, not just wealth.
Iran has now restarted its nuclear program and has become more, rather than less, aggressive. Trump's Iran policy has alienated us from our allies and taken us to the brink of another war in the Middle East.

Everything this president does is backwards.
Iran needs to get back into compliance with its nuclear commitments, but Trump appears to have no plan for ensuring that result either. His policy of maximum pressure has produced worse than minimum results.
And even as Trump has rushed to legitimize a dictator in North Korea with dozens of nuclear weapons, he trashed the Iran nuclear deal — a deal that was working to keep Iran far away from a single nuclear bomb.
Not one missile or nuclear weapon has been destroyed, not one inspector is on the ground. If anything, the situation has gotten worse. North Korea has continued to churn out fissile material and is no longer an isolated pariah on the world stage.
In this case, all Trump achieved was a mere promise to restart working-level negotiations — negotiations that should have never ended.
Yet again, Donald Trump has demonstrated that he is more concerned with a photo op for himself than getting results for the American people. He has repeatedly elevated Kim Jong Un — a murderous tyrant — on the international stage in exchange for almost nothing.
President Trump’s failure to lead on the climate crisis is inexcusable — it endangers the future of our country and planet.

As president, I’ll rejoin the #ParisAgreement and rally the world to push our progress further and faster.

Yesterday’s verdict doesn’t take away the pain or the loss of Heather Heyer on that day in Charlottesville, but is hopefully a step toward healing and a sense of justice. https://t.co/CZLYSTUtMC
The same forces of hatred rooted in 'birtherism' that questioned @BarackObama's American citizenship, and even his racial identity, are now being used against Senator @KamalaHarris. It’s disgusting and we have to call it out when we see it. Racism has no place in America.
We're in a battle for the soul of this nation. We can end the politics of division that’s pulling this country apart and move forward again ⁠— but it’s going to take everyone rolling up their sleeves and doing their part.

Let's get to work. https://t.co/Q3Y1el5tOY
I’ve fought my heart out to ensure that civil rights, voting rights, and equal rights are enforced everywhere. These rights are not up to the states to decide. They are embedded in our Constitution.

Hey everyone — @TeamJoe here! We’re taking over @JoeBiden’s account while he’s on stage for tonight’s Democratic debate. Throughout the evening, we’ll be giving you the facts on Joe and his record. #DemDebate
I’m about to take the debate stage. The large, diverse Democratic field is evidence of our party's strength. And above all, we all agree that we need to make Donald Trump a one-term president. #DemDebate
We have to choose hope over fear, truth over lies, and unity over division. I hope you’ll tune in tonight as we discuss these important issues and more. If you like what you hear, I ask you to join us by signing up at https://t.co/FiM7U862fT. Let’s get to work.
We can do all this and more – all that stands in the way is a broken political system. We have to unite this country. And we can do it without compromising our principles. That’s the only way we’re going to be able to harness the incredible potential of the American people.
Climate change is an existential threat. We have to take urgent, drastic action now to address the climate emergency. On day one, I’ll take the bold action necessary to tackle this crisis head-on and rally the world to raise our ambitions. https://t.co/Tg2yqpL8DO
We have to transform education. We’ll provide universal Pre-K, triple Title I funding, raise teacher pay, double the number of mental health professionals in our schools, and eliminate disparities between rich and poor schools. https://t.co/6oqEuc5N8Q
Under my plan, everyone will have the option to buy into a public health plan like Medicare. And we’ll guarantee that the poor – who otherwise would be covered by the Medicaid expansion – are automatically covered, free of charge.
We need to defend and build on the Affordable Care Act. I was proud every day to serve alongside President Obama as Vice President – but never more so than the day the Affordable Care Act passed. Now we have to finish the job.
It’s time to reward work, not just wealth. On day one, I’ll move to: eliminate the Trump tax cut for the super-wealthy, cut the unjustified loopholes in our tax code, and use that money to invest in America’s future.
The poor are getting poorer and the bottom is falling out of the middle class. Income inequality is on the rise — made worse by the Trump tax cut that was a giant give-away to the super-wealthy.
We have to rebuild the backbone of this nation – the middle class. And this time make sure everyone comes along, regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, or disability.
Every day we are being reminded what this election is about. Who we are. What we stand for. What we believe. I am running to offer our country a different path – not back to a past that never was, but to a future that fulfills our true potential as a country.
We know in our bones this election is different. We have a president who promotes hate and division. Encourages white supremacists. Embraces dictators. And damages our alliances internationally.

Our politics traffics in division. And our president is the divider in chief.
In an hour, I’ll take the stage for the first Democratic debate to discuss my vision for the country. As I’ve said from day one, I’m running for president for three reasons: to restore the soul of this nation, rebuild its backbone — the middle class, and unify all Americans.
From day one, we've refused to take money from any corporate PACs or lobbyists. Today, I’m building on that base by signing @NoFossilMoney’s pledge to reject support from the PACs, lobbyists, or executives of fossil fuel companies.

I work for you — not any industry. https://t.co/f8HxB89F9V
In America, every worker deserves fair treatment, safe workplaces, and the right to join a union. Period. I’m proud to stand in solidarity with airport workers across the country as they strike for their right to organize. #RespectUSworkers
Today’s decision from the court hopefully means there will not be a question on the 2020 Census, but we have much more work to do to ensure all voices are heard in our democracy.
Make no mistake, the Trump Administration added a citizenship question to the Census to deliberately cut out the voices of immigrants and communities of color. It’s wrong and goes against our core values as a nation.
Today the Supreme Court refused to stop politicians rigging our democracy by writing election rules for their own benefit. It couldn’t have happened without Justices put there by Donald Trump and Republicans — another reason why Democrats must take back the White House in 2020.
I was proud to sign @IndivisibleTeam’s pledge. Our large and diverse set of qualified Democratic candidates is evidence of our strength as a party, and I am committed to supporting whomever becomes the nominee. The most important thing is to beat Donald Trump. Period. https://t.co/KiBiOOZpDm
All marriages, at their root, are about love. And four years ago, the Supreme Court affirmed that simple proposition in Obergefell v. Hodges. Thank you to the generations of LGBTQ trailblazers who refused to bend before the voices of intolerance. Your courage changed the world.
This image is gut-wrenching. The cruelty we're seeing at our border is unconscionable. History will judge how we respond to the Trump Administration’s treatment of immigrant families &amp; children—we can’t be silent. This isn't who we are. This is not America.https://t.co/ZeMBmwUHxU
One year ago, the Supreme Court upheld Trump's Muslim ban—one of this administration's most egregious attacks on our core values. Wielding the politics of fear and intolerance by slandering entire religious communities as complicit in terrorism is wrong, and it’s not who we are.
DREAMers are Americans, and Congress needs to make it official. The millions of DREAMers and undocumented individuals in the United States can only be brought out of the shadows through fair treatment, not ugly threats.
In two days, I’ll take the stage for the first Democratic debate to discuss my vision for the country. If you haven’t yet, RSVP to attend a watch party in your community today: https://t.co/ai8Gixr1tV https://t.co/o5pV6OJN76

The Trump Administration is arguing in the 9th Circuit that migrant children held in detention centers without soap, toothbrushes or beds are in conditions that are “safe and sanitary”.

It’s an all-out assault on human dignity and our standards as a nation. We must do better.
Trump’s erratic, impulsive actions are the last thing we need as Commander-in-Chief. No president should order a military strike without fully understanding the consequences. We don’t need another war in the Middle East, but Trump’s actions toward Iran only make that more likely.

I stopped by @TheStonewallNYC to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the uprising that changed our world forever. https://t.co/i2ShQVIKjm
What we need is presidential leadership that will take strategic action to counter the Iranian threat, restore America's standing in the world, recognize the value of principled diplomacy, and strengthen our nation and our security by working strategically with our allies.
Make no mistake: Iran continues to be a bad actor that abuses human rights and supports terrorist activities throughout the region.
It’s sadly ironic that the State Department is now calling on Iran to abide by the very deal the Trump Administration abandoned.

By walking away from diplomacy, Trump has made military conflict more likely. Another war in the Middle East is the last thing we need.
But they’ve only gotten more aggressive. Trump also promised that walking away would somehow lead to a better deal – instead, the predictable has happened: Iran is building back up its nuclear capability.
He unilaterally withdrew from the hard-won nuclear agreement that the Obama-Biden Administration negotiated to stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. Trump promised that abandoning the deal and imposing sanctions would stop Iran’s aggression in the region.
President Trump's Iran strategy is a self-inflicted disaster. Two of America's vital interests in the Middle East are preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon and securing a stable energy supply through the Strait of Hormuz. Trump is failing on both counts.
As we recognize Juneteenth and the progress we’ve made since slavery, we must also double down on our efforts to root out systemic racism. We have to make sure we’re working to move closer to that more perfect union, to the idea of America that has inspired so many generations.
America was founded on the ideals of equality, equity, &amp; fairness—but has failed to live up to that promise for all people. In 2019, the unemployment rate for black people is almost twice that of white people. Children born poor are twice as likely to stay poor if they’re black.
Trump’s policies appear intentionally designed to aggravate the situation to scare Americans into re-electing him. Cutting off aid to Central America will increase migration to our Southern border, not reduce it.
President Trump threatening the mass deportation of immigrants is cruel and un-American. We can fix our broken immigration system and enforce our laws without tossing aside our values. https://t.co/0NE6CitDKM
This is truly the most important election of our lifetime. If we want to defeat Donald Trump, it’s going to take everyone stepping up, speaking out, and taking action.

Join our team today and let’s get to work: https://t.co/gnaFCACYrW
Trump’s response to Charlottesville two years ago was abhorrent, but it’s not just that. It’s happening every day. Separating children from their parents at the border. Attacking women's rights. Rolling back LGBTQ protections. 

We’re better than this.
Just look at his tax plan.

As president, Biden will reverse Trump’s tax cuts for the super wealthy. It’s time we reward work, not just wealth.
https://t.co/byDWQAumwg
Let’s be clear: President Trump inherited a growing economy from the Obama-Biden administration. And now, he’s in the process of squandering it.
Hey there - @TeamJoe here. President Trump dismisses everything he doesn’t want to hear as “FAKE NEWS” -- so as he announces his re-election, we want to make sure you have the real facts on his record:
For all the hard-won progress, for as much as we can celebrate how much better things have gotten — this fight is not over.

We have to come together to stand up to abuses of power, ensure that everyone is treated with dignity, and fight for full equality. https://t.co/aCoWE0hggC
Stopped by @TheStonewallNYC to celebrate #PrideMonth &amp; #WorldPride where the movement began 50 years ago. https://t.co/2Z4PyfzyOq

I’ll be taking the stage at 9PM ET on June 27 for the first Democratic debate!

We’re organizing debate watch parties in every corner of the country for the big night and need your help. Sign up to host one in your community: https://t.co/3TRBR6Fz8i
This weekend, I’m heading to South Carolina for the @SCDP Convention and world-famous #ClyburnFishFry! RSVP to come out and join us: https://t.co/r0RlGVVUmE
Under President Trump’s policies, a four-month-old was separated from his family at the border. It’s unconscionable and fundamentally at odds with everything our nation stands for.

America is better than this. https://t.co/hQY3xISf7r
Happy anniversary to the love of my life and the life of my love, @DrBiden. I’m forever grateful you agreed to spend the rest of your life with me. I love you, Jilly! https://t.co/HwCQIjFc4J
It will also include premium-free access to this public option for people who would otherwise qualify for Medicaid, but have been denied access to it by governors and state legislatures who have refused the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion.
Lastly, I discussed how my health care plan will include access to a Medicare-like public option for anyone who wants it.
I declared that we have to do everything we can to protect the most sacred, fundamental right we have: the right to vote.
I discussed how in a Biden Administration, we’ll support teachers and ensure every kid has access to a quality education. Because in America, no child’s future should be determined by their zip code, parents’ income, race, or disability. https://t.co/d1o4WnDczV
I talked about how the greatest sin is the abuse of power — whether economic, or physical, or social. And, it’s our duty to fight back against those who would abuse it.

That starts with access to a real living wage — a $15 minimum wage.
I was honored to join @UniteThePoor, @RevDrBarber, and @liztheo at today’s #PPCMoralCongress Presidential Forum.
Today, I took @EricHolder's @demredistrict pledge to support #FairMaps. For too long, gerrymandering has allowed politicians to pick who they represent. That’s wrong. I’m committed to fair redistricting where elected officials are accountable to those they represent.
Four years ago, a white supremacist walked into Mother Emanuel and gunned down nine brave souls, including my friend Clementa Pinckney. It's not enough to remember them. We have to fight for them. We are in a battle for the soul of this nation.
7 years ago, @BarackObama and I offered security to DREAMers, young people brought here as kids who only know America as home. Trump is trying to break our country's promise to them &amp; continues to threaten their status.

DREAMers are Americans. It’s time we kept our word to them.
Good luck to the @USWNT as they take on Chile! 

As we cheer them on in the World Cup, we must support their fight off the field for equal pay. In 2019, it’s past time we close the pay gap and ensure women get paid as much as men. #OneNationOneTeam https://t.co/bJQZm2aQMv
As my father believed, there’s no higher calling for a woman or a man than to be a good mother or a good father. Happy Father’s Day to all the dads out there who work every day to help raise their children—and all our children—to be honorable, generous, kind young men and women. https://t.co/6B8hbfOIft
This country wasn’t built by Wall Street bankers, CEOs, or hedge fund managers. It was built by the American middle class. It’s time we recognize that.

We’ve got to build an economy and a tax code that rewards work, not just wealth.
In America, no child’s future should be determined by their zip code, parents’ income, race, or disability. In a Biden Administration, we’ll invest in our students, schools, and educators to ensure every kid gets a fair shot.

The extraordinary bravery shown by hundreds of thousands in Hong Kong, marching for the civil liberties &amp; autonomy promised by China is inspiring. And the world is watching. All of us must stand in support of democratic principles and freedom.
This is simple. No candidate running for office should help foreign governments undermine our democracy. That includes the sitting President of the United States. Our elections should be decided by the American people — not Vladimir Putin.
Donald Trump doesn’t think it matters if candidates accept damaging intel on their opponent from a foreign government. He’s dead wrong.

That’s why I’m signing the Pledge for Election Integrity. I refuse to help those who seek to undermine our democracy. https://t.co/Zw7DKYXc1h https://t.co/3NGezt58hx
Every worker in this country deserves the dignity that comes with fair wages and benefits — and the right to collectively bargain. I’m proud to stand with Detroit security officers today as they fight for a $15 minimum wage and union rights. #OneDetroit

I have nothing against Amazon, but no company pulling in billions of dollars of profits should pay a lower tax rate than firefighters and teachers. We need to reward work, not just wealth. https://t.co/R6xaN3vXGT
President Trump is once again welcoming foreign interference in our elections. This isn’t about politics. It is a threat to our national security. An American President should not seek their aid and abet those who seek to undermine democracy.
We had a great day in Iowa talking about how we rebuild the backbone of our country — the middle class. Thank you to everyone who came out to join us! https://t.co/49jUzP89F1
Today in 1967, the Supreme Court struck down interracial marriage bans in Loving v. Virginia—a decision that inched us closer to our founding ideals of equality, equity, &amp; fairness.

The decision reminds us progress doesn’t happen on its own—every generation has to fight for it.
Our 9/11 first responders represent the best of our country — selflessly rushing into danger to save others. We owe them so much, and the least we can do is provide the health care and benefits they deserve. 

Thank you, Jon Stewart, for continuing to have their backs. https://t.co/AHvAupqIyc
Prayers are not enough to end these senseless mass shootings. This violence is not normal. As a country, we have a moral obligation to do everything in our power to stop the gun violence epidemic.
Three years later, the horrific attack on Pulse Nightclub still shakes our nation to the core. A night that should have been a celebration of love and life was cut short by unspeakable terror. Today, we remember those we lost — including so many in the LGBTQ community. https://t.co/vdNyZEjlRr
President Trump thinks his tariffs are being paid by China. Just like he thinks Mexico is building the wall.
Tomorrow, we’re heading to Clinton, Iowa, and hope to see you there! RSVP at https://t.co/MwCakzlMdm and spread the word to family and friends.
President Trump is bringing his secret one page agreement with Mexico to Iowa. The Iowans being crushed by his tariffs would like to see it.
Good luck to the @USWNT as they kick off their first game of the Women’s World Cup. @DrBiden and I will be rooting for you! We have no doubt you’ll make our country proud. #OneNationOneTeam https://t.co/BCtOFAtSRt
Thank you for following along this afternoon! Follow @TeamJoe to keep up with everything happening on the campaign. #TeamJoe
We can’t afford four more years of an administration that gambles with the livelihoods of American families. Working families deserve a president who is fighting for them. #TeamJoe
Trump doesn’t get the basics. He thinks his tariffs are being paid by China. Any freshman econ student could tell you that the American people are paying his tariffs.

The cashiers at Target see what’s going on – they know more about economics than Trump. #TeamJoe
He thinks he’s being tough. Well, it’s easy to be tough when someone else is feeling the pain. How many farmers across Iowa and across this nation are facing the prospect of losing their business, of losing their farm because of Trump’s tariffs? #TeamJoe
Tune in here: https://t.co/4rTMVjJzyb
When it comes to President Trump’s tariff war with China, one thing is clear: America’s farmers and manufacturers are getting crushed – no one knows that better than Iowa. 

To Trump, the people getting hurt are just pawns in his game. #TeamJoe
Hey everyone, @TeamJoe here. We’re taking over to keep you in the loop on our event in Ottumwa, Iowa. Stay tuned! #TeamJoe
I'm headed to eastern Iowa this week to talk with voters about our vision for the future. Head to https://t.co/r0RlGWdvLe to RSVP to an event in your community.
It was great to be back in Atlanta! Thank you to Mayor @KeishaBottoms for showing me around town and for your work expanding opportunity to every corner of the city. https://t.co/kmhmeN5lHm
President Trump’s decision to abandon the #ParisAgreement wasn't just reckless—it abdicated our leadership on the world stage and threatened the future of our planet.
 
On day one, I’ll rejoin the Agreement and rally the world to push our progress further. https://t.co/0Wxk0RIYvs
Jill &amp; I were thrilled to be there today to watch our amazing granddaughter Maisy graduate. Maisy, you make us so proud &amp; we can’t wait to see what you do next with your talent, smarts, dedication and kindness. The future is yours, and Nana &amp; Pop will always be right behind you. https://t.co/zj80Kee4l3

Iowa, we’re heading your way next week and hope to see you there! Go to https://t.co/r0RlGWdvLe to RSVP to an event in your community.
This campaign is about listening to communities and working with them to find solutions to the issues on their minds. Yesterday we held a roundtable to do just that.

Thank you to everyone who shared their stories with me in Atlanta. https://t.co/xSyn19iT7L
I know how to beat the NRA because I’ve done it before - twice. I shepherded through the passage of the Brady background check bill in 1993, and bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines in 1994. As president, I will defeat the NRA again.
We can’t let a special interest group dictate the safety of the rest of the country. That’s why defeating the NRA is a key element of our education policy we introduced last week.
We will be rolling out policies to reduce gun violence in the coming months, but it’s clear we need to: 
- Close the loophole that allows individuals to buy guns online or at gun shows without a background check.
- Ban the sale of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.
There are actions that Congress can take right now if they were to listen to the majority of the American people who want to see our government take action to stop gun violence.
We don't need to convince the American public that common-sense measures to reduce gun violence are a good idea. 2 in 3 people believe that we need stricter gun laws.
This is politics at its worst. We should all feel safe to walk the streets of our own cities and towns. Our workers should feel safe at work. Our students should always feel safe at school.
We need action. But the NRA and gun manufacturers have such a firm grip on Republicans in Congress that they refuse to consider common-sense gun reforms.
Today is #NationalGunViolenceAwarenessDay. Our team, and people across the country, are wearing orange in remembrance of the countless lives that have been cut short by senseless acts of gun violence in America.
Women’s rights and health care are under assault in a way that seeks to roll back every step of progress we’ve made over the last 50 years. If I believe health care is a right, as I do, I can no longer support an amendment that makes that right dependent on someone’s zip code.
Today, we honor all those who answered duty’s call on June 6, 1944, not only in memorials and remembrances, but in recommitting ourselves to the urgent task of defending those values for which they fought and so many died.
Their valor cemented in history their place of honor and it planted the seeds of what would grow to become the greatest military alliance in the history of the world—one that would preserve the peace and extend the hard won gains of democracy for their children and grandchildren.
We will never forget what the conviction and mettle of those young patriots achieved—for all of us.
With uncommon courage and unfailing honor, Allied forces claimed the first few feet in the drive to turn back an empire born of hatred and prevent it from consuming Europe. They did it not for personal posterity or political gain, but simply because there was no other choice.
75 years ago, far from home, on those bloody beachheads of Normandy, thousands of brave young Americans risked everything to prove that freedom, justice, and democracy would never bend before the forces of fascism and intolerance.
We can’t afford four more years of President Trump attacking the progress we’ve made on climate change. On day one as president, I’ll take the bold action necessary to tackle this crisis head on. https://t.co/PTXHzn1PXM
We had a great few days on the campaign trail in New Hampshire. Thank you to everyone who came out to join us! I look forward to being back soon. https://t.co/oQA6EhBT5f

Estamos enfrentando una emergencia climática y debemos tomar medidas drásticas ya. Por eso, hoy, estoy anunciando mi plan para una Revolución de Energía Limpia y Justicia Ambiental. https://t.co/QcC4JKSkvj
China’s continuing oppression of its own people, especially the abuse and internment of more than one million Uyghurs, is one of the worst human rights crises in the world today. It can’t be ignored. Human rights must be at the core—not periphery—of our engagement in the world.
Today is the anniversary of China's brutal crackdown in Tiananmen Square. Authorities tried to stop peaceful calls for political change with rifles &amp; tanks. The courage of the Tiananmen generation hasn't been silenced &amp; still inspires the fight for freedom and justice worldwide.
Making these revolutionary changes is going to take an incredible commitment at all levels, but I know we can meet this challenge.

Because this is what America does best—solving big problems, with big ideas. If you agree, please sign your name here: https://t.co/Fn5XTDtfQZ
We need to dramatically accelerate our worldwide effort to meet the intensity of the challenge we face. I hope you'll read my full plan to tackle the climate emergency and environmental injustices: 
https://t.co/XJsdFWUo9j
I will rejoin the Paris Climate Accord on Day One. But that’s not sufficient.

I’ll immediately get to work leading a diplomatic initiative to get every nation to go beyond their initial commitment—to push our progress further, and faster.

https://t.co/Fn5XTDtfQZ https://t.co/x8X0qhu8qZ
This initiative will create new, good-paying jobs all across the clean economy in the United States of America. It’s an enormous opportunity.

https://t.co/2sXQy4kQ1J https://t.co/jMzUjmXwoV
We’re going to make record-breaking investments in research and development and zero-carbon technologies so that America is the engine of the world’s clean economy.

The United States will be a 100% clean-energy economy with net-zero emissions by 2050.

https://t.co/Fn5XTDtfQZ https://t.co/ypw4o7rozG
Science tells us that how we act, or fail to act, in the next 12 years will determine the very livability of our planet. As president, I will use every authority available to me to drive progress.

I will accept no half-measures.
https://t.co/Fn5XTDtfQZ
Today, President Trump denies the evidence in front of his own eyes, hides climate science produced by his own administration, and actively works to roll back what progress we have already made.

It’s reckless, it’s irresponsible, and it’s unacceptable. https://t.co/3r9TqKKqGQ
We are in a climate emergency and we must take drastic action now to address it. So today, I’m announcing my plan for a Clean Energy Revolution and Environmental Justice.

https://t.co/FbsOsyQkIo https://t.co/SBDrdiFu2C
We have a major problem with educational inequality and we need to tackle it head on. In a Biden Administration, we’ll triple Title I funding — creating a historic investment in schools serving a high proportion of children from low-income families. https://t.co/14A6BoG428
Happy birthday to the love of my life and the life of my love, @DrBiden. Jilly, I love you. https://t.co/WFwlUCuowv

Gun violence occurs every day across America. Enough is enough.
Not every life lost makes national headlines, but it's just as painful for those left behind. This is an epidemic plaguing our communities &amp; destroying our children’s futures. We must act now. https://t.co/PYAHoAFmjQ
Pride is about standing up to the voices of injustice and discrimination and declaring that everyone has the right to live proud, open, and free. It's about love. We join the LGBTQ community in celebration and remember the fight is not over. We march on. Happy #PrideMonth
America’s teachers have been forced to make ends meet with too little pay and too few resources. That changes with a Biden Administration. We’ll finally support our educators with the pay and dignity they deserve. https://t.co/Rvl0MkS0XF
One in five children experience mental health challenges, but too many don’t get help. My plan doubles the number of mental health professionals in schools to ensure every student gets the support they need.

My dad used to say that you know you are a success as a parent when you turn &amp; look at your child &amp; realize they turned out better than you — I'm so proud of the man Beau became.
We’ve got to invest in every child — regardless of zip code or race or parents' income. In a Biden Administration, we’ll provide high-quality, universal pre-K for all three- and four-year-olds to ensure every kid gets a fair shot.

Our plan will increase teacher pay and provide them with the support they deserve. We’ll invest in all children from birth, so that regardless of their zip code, parents’ income, race, or disability they are prepared to succeed in tomorrow’s economy.
I’ve seen firsthand how hard teachers work with little support and few resources. We’ve got to do better. That’s why today, surrounded by America’s teachers, we laid out our plan for educators, students, and our future: https://t.co/d1o4WnDczV. https://t.co/6UxCx8bvjb

I’m proud to stand with @SEIU and workers across the country today in the #FightFor15. We must restore the dignity of work and ensure everyone’s treated with respect. That starts with raising the minimum wage to $15, strengthening our unions, and creating safe work environments. https://t.co/Df9rUJe6Ky
Over the last year, six children have tragically died in US custody at the border. It’s unacceptable. It’s not who we are. And silence is complicity. It’s on all of us to stand up and speak out. America is a nation of immigrants. We must guarantee everyone's treated with dignity.
On Saturday, we officially kicked off our campaign in Philadelphia — the city that brought our nation together over 200 years ago. I’m running for president to unite our country, because when we come together and act as one America there’s nothing we can’t accomplish. https://t.co/syRNWo5c6i
In the 25 years since we passed the Violence Against Women Act, we’ve made great strides in protecting women from abuse. But the latest reauthorization is being held up by the @NRA. It’s outrageous. This shouldn’t be a partisan issue—the Senate should pass the #VAWA immediately.

My dad had to make that walk in Scranton, Pennsylvania. It wasn’t until I was older that I realized how hard it must have been for him.

But he was not alone. This story isn’t unique to the Bidens. Too many people around this country have had to make that walk.
And he doesn’t understand that the longest walk a parent can make is up a short flight of stairs to their child’s bedroom to say, honey, I'm sorry. We have to move. You can’t go back to your school. You won’t see your friends because Daddy or Mommy lost their job.
Trump doesn’t understand the struggles working folks go through. He doesn’t understand what it’s like to worry you will lose the roof over your head. He doesn’t understand what it’s like to wonder if you’ll be able to put food on the table.
Yesterday, Trump tried to attack me at his campaign rally by saying I abandoned Pennsylvania.

I’ve never forgotten where I came from. My family did have to leave Pennsylvania when I was 10 — we moved to Delaware where my Dad found a job that could provide for our family.
States across the nation are passing extreme laws that violate a woman’s constitutional right to choose. These bills are a blatant attempt to overturn Roe v Wade. It's wrong. It's pernicious.

Thank you to everyone who joined us in Philadelphia, attended watch parties in all 50 states and Puerto Rico, and tuned in across the nation. We're just getting started. I know if we work together, there's nothing we can't do. Sign up to join us: https://t.co/gnaFCACYrW https://t.co/EL4OSyW1NI
Thanks so much for following along this afternoon! Follow @TeamJoe to stay up-to-date on everything happening on the campaign. #TeamJoe signing off!
America has stood as a beacon of hope around the world for generations. #TeamJoe https://t.co/cFPN8D8qDW
Joe helped make government work before, and he’ll make it work again. #TeamJoe https://t.co/E5vA58zhcL
At the core of our campaign is a simple idea: we are at our best when we’re one America. #TeamJoe https://t.co/92bQIcV7wp
We choose hope over fear, truth over lies, and unity over division. #TeamJoe https://t.co/rg0wC4irnC
It’s up to every generation to do the work to protect and perfect our democracy. #TeamJoe https://t.co/X7YlONYEkF
Joe introduced one of the first climate change bills in the Senate and has been at the forefront of the fight ever since. As president, he’ll take aggressive action to protect our planet for future generations. #TeamJoe https://t.co/8gADghxGuw
Our nation was founded on the principles of equality, equity, and fairness. But from day one, America has failed to live up to that promise for most of its people. 

We must do better. We can do better. #TeamJoe https://t.co/HEyxi8MGyI
Simply put: we are better than this. #TeamJoe https://t.co/DKObz89vo8
We the People. Those three words changed everything. #TeamJoe https://t.co/YBZQumFBzK
.@TeamJoe here! We’re taking over to keep you in the loop on our campaign’s official kickoff in Philadelphia. If you aren’t already, head to https://t.co/xk0GcSpr50 to tune in.
I’m about to take the stage, so I’m handing over the account to my staff to make sure you don’t miss a thing. Head to https://t.co/xk0GcSpr50 to tune in as we launch our campaign.
The life of my love — the love of my life — the person who put our family back together. I love you, Jilly! @DrBiden
Over 200 years ago, our nation was born out of a bold statement: We the People.

Not You. Not Me. But We. https://t.co/lpZQhhHCIc
Watch Live: Joe Biden Officially Launches Campaign for President https://t.co/HECZJ3EXsz
I’m so excited to be in Philadelphia — the birthplace of American democracy — to launch our campaign. I’ll be taking the stage soon, head to https://t.co/xk0GcSpr50 to tune in.
No one should be fired, denied a home or access to services because of who they are or who they love. But that’s not the reality for many LGBTQ Americans.

Today’s historic passage of the #EqualityAct moves us one step closer to righting this wrong — the Senate should act now.
At the core of our campaign is the idea that we always do better when we act as one America. If we choose unity over division there’s nothing we can’t do. Tune in tomorrow at 1 PM ET to join us as we kick off our campaign in Philadelphia: https://t.co/xk0GcSpr50 https://t.co/p7YbYtSCYG
Thank you to the @NVAssemblyDems &amp; @NVSenateDems for their hard work — and the people of Nevada for making this a reality. The Silver State is in good hands with these women leading the way. https://t.co/jiOThF0OOh
Our campaign is built on restoring the American idea, that all men and women are created equal. That’s why we’re basing our campaign in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania -- the birthplace of this great experiment, American democracy. https://t.co/G1JPu0E5Jk
Los EEUU fueron fundados con una simple frase: We the people. Nosotros el Pueblo. Me postulo para Presidente para unificar nuestro país y asegurar que alcancemos el ideal de nuestros fundadores. Únase este sábado en Filadelfia para lanzar nuestra campaña: https://t.co/a9SS6Ggm4Z https://t.co/kWlWwQzklI
I’m running for president to restore the soul of this nation, rebuild its backbone — the middle class, and unify all Americans.

If you’re with me, join us as we launch our campaign in Philadelphia this Saturday: https://t.co/a9SS6Ggm4Z https://t.co/Ib7TWqFNUh
It was good to be back in New Hampshire! Thank you to everyone who came out to join us in Hampton, Manchester, and Nashua. https://t.co/EEQeowo1yG
Thank you to the hundreds of people who joined us yesterday in the cold and rain in Nashua, NH. Our political system is broken, but I’m more optimistic about America’s chances today than I have ever been. If we come together and remember who we are, there’s nothing we can’t do. https://t.co/3xwB6lPnDc
Republicans in AL, FL, GA, and OH are ushering in laws that clearly violate Roe v Wade and they should be declared unconstitutional. Roe v Wade is settled law and should not be overturned. This choice should remain between a woman and her doctor.
Everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect under the law—regardless of who they are or who they love. Now is not the time to back down. We must stand up to this Administration's intolerance and ensure America lives up to our founding ideals. https://t.co/IY0JvqzxOU
This Saturday, we’re officially launching our campaign to unite this country in Philadelphia — the city that first brought our nation together over 200 years ago. We’d love to see you there, head to https://t.co/a9SS6Ggm4Z to RSVP and learn more. https://t.co/feuLM8WnAN
Every American should be encouraged to exercise their right to vote. I stand with @JeanneShaheen in opposing the voter suppression law that makes it harder for students in New Hampshire to participate in our political process. This law should be overturned. https://t.co/CCSoaeukNx
Join us in Philadelphia on Saturday, May 18th, as we officially launch our campaign! Head to https://t.co/a9SS6FYKGp to RSVP today.
Our campaign starts at the local level. Neighbors talking with neighbors, communities coming together—that’s how we’ll change the country. That’s why we’re organizing watch parties all across this nation to launch our campaign. Sign up to host yours today. https://t.co/AVCOrPu0oJ
New Hampshire, we’re heading to Manchester tomorrow and we’d love to see you there! Head to https://t.co/AmHGUD929H to RSVP.
My mom was an incredible woman, and I miss her. She would always tell us that “courage is the greatest virtue, because without courage you cannot love with abandon.” She lived her life that way, loving us with abandon. I want to wish every mother out there a Happy Mother’s Day. https://t.co/zlpNBjY79g

We need policies that reflect this urgency. I'll have more specifics on how America can lead on climate in the coming weeks.
I’m proud to have been one of the first to introduce climate change legislation. What I fought for in 1986 is more important than ever — climate change is an existential threat. Now. Today.
Our movement’s strength is rooted in communities all across this country. That’s why we’re bringing together #TeamJoe to officially kick off our campaign. Sign up to help by hosting a watch party in your community at https://t.co/UifVy6wxCb. https://t.co/sAFac86Nex
It’s time we restore the great American middle class that built this country. That starts with making a $15 minimum wage the law of the land, ensuring health care is a right not a privilege, and creating a tax code that rewards work, not just wealth. https://t.co/6w9DZZoGSJ
Thanks to my friend, Mayor @EricGarcetti for the tacos yesterday in Los Angeles. I’ll be back soon and the ice cream is on me. https://t.co/6D5MrvCZzP
I’m proud to stand with Uber and Lyft drivers across the country today. Every worker in this country deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.
We’re officially kicking off our campaign with a rally in Philadelphia on Saturday, May 18th! RSVP to join us by heading to https://t.co/a9SS6Ggm4Z.
We must remember Kendrick's name and sacrifice. We must ensure his legacy lives in our shared commitment to stopping these tragedies. Children shouldn’t fear going to school and parents shouldn't need to rely on the uncommon courage of an 18-year-old hero to keep their kids safe.
Kendrick Castillo will not collect his high school diploma this week because he gave his life trying to protect his classmates from another senseless act of violence in an American school yesterday. My heart goes out to his family and all those affected by yesterday's shooting.
One year ago, this Administration began ripping apart immigrant families. Putting children in cages. As I told @Astrid_NV and other brave activists today, we can fix our broken immigration system without tossing aside our values. https://t.co/zYCz1PViOX
I’m so inspired by @DrBiden for her dedication to educating future generations. Happy #TeacherAppreciationDay to all the hardworking educators out there! https://t.co/wAZ4rseqkq

@samanthapetrick Hey Rocco, happy 9th birthday! Sorry I missed the party. I hope you got some ice cream with that #Biden2020 cookie.
Congratulations to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, on the birth of their baby boy! The truth is there’s no better job than being a parent. Jill and I wish you the best of luck on your next chapter.
On Saturday, Jill and I visited Columbia, South Carolina, to discuss how we’ll build an inclusive middle class where everyone — regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, religion or disability — comes along. Thank you to everyone who joined us, we’ll be back soon! https://t.co/jly3piXzPE
Nevada, we’re taking our campaign to Henderson tomorrow, May 7th! Head to https://t.co/zTS0WldilG to RSVP and come join us.
On this first day of Ramadan, Jill and I wish peace and happiness to Muslims around the world celebrating the holy month. Ramadan Kareem.
Our country may seem more divided than ever, but I know our best days are still ahead. It’s time we lift our heads up and remember who we are. If you’re ready to get to work, join our campaign today. https://t.co/lyhRyWPhvS
We’re in the battle for the soul of this nation, but I’ve never been more optimistic about our future. If we work together, I know we can get this country back on track. Join our campaign: https://t.co/lyhRyWPhvS
America is an idea that has grown stronger through the unique contributions of Latinos. @latinovictoryus works tirelessly to empower the community — congrats on 5 years. https://t.co/RtU4weYxnT

Thank you for the warm welcome, Columbia! It’s always great to be back in South Carolina. https://t.co/P2YMTy236V
I’ve seen the selfless heroism of firefighters firsthand — they run toward danger and risk their lives every single day for strangers. On International Firefighters' Day, I extend my deepest gratitude to all the men and women who keep our communities safe.
Tough, resilient, and always full of hope — that’s the America I know and that’s the America we must restore. It’s time to dig deep, take action, and fight for the soul of this nation. Join our campaign and let’s get to work. https://t.co/lyhRyWPhvS
Since we launched our campaign last week, we’ve seen Americans in every corner of the country step up and say they’re in. Will you join us? Head to https://t.co/twQHMjvY7e and be part of our team.
Last year, Floridians voted to restore voting rights to those who served their time for felonies. But today, Florida's Senate votes on a bill that would instead create a modern-day poll tax, suppressing the vote of tens of thousands of Americans. This is unacceptable.
On Holocaust Remembrance Day, let us pause and reflect on the millions of Jews who lost their lives at the hands of the Nazi regime.

The events of the last few months remind us that it’s not enough to just say never again—we must speak up and act against hate.
This country wasn’t built by Wall Street bankers and CEOs and Hedge Fund Managers. It was built by you — the great American middle class. I’m thankful for all the support this week from union membership and their families, including the IAFF. https://t.co/0utHvHuUyi
Today, the House votes on #HR9, the #ClimateActionNow Act, which restores our commitment to the #ParisAgreement. We need to face facts on climate change. It’s already here. It is a major threat to our future and we simply cannot wait to take action.
Happy 48th Birthday to @Amtrak and the incredible men and women whose tireless work every day keeps the trains running and our country moving. https://t.co/vz9pxE84Ja
I’m the proud husband of a teacher and know first-hand the impact of their work. Teachers around the country and in South Carolina deserve to earn a living wage and have smaller class sizes so that America can continue to out-educate and lead the world. #AllOutMay1
The violence in Venezuela today against peaceful protesters is criminal. Maduro's regime is responsible for incredible suffering. The U.S. must stand with the National Assembly &amp; Guaidó in their efforts to restore democracy through legitimate, internationally monitored elections.
It's no secret that I love ice cream. I enjoyed stopping by The Cone Shoppe in Monticello for some chocolate/vanilla twist soft serve and the chance to talk with some Iowans after our first campaign stop. https://t.co/jVFLBUwFp6
It was great to see many of our first responders and union leaders in Cedar Rapids today. This country was built by hard working Americans like you, and I look forward to being back soon! https://t.co/qhtqdfweht
Today, The House will hold it's first hearing on the Equal Rights Amendment in 36 years. It's way past time to give all people protection under the Constitution--human rights should never be caught up in the whims of whichever political party is in power. We need the #ERANow.
Serving as @BarackObama's Vice President was a privilege and an honor. We share the belief that America is a place where ordinary people do extraordinary things and anything is possible. https://t.co/Y5rXEijgIu
Folks, we’re just getting started! I’ll be heading to Iowa next. Visit https://t.co/7Je6uld7qQ for event details and to RSVP. Hope to see you soon!
We must turbocharge our efforts to address climate change that threatens communities across the country. Through clean, renewable energy and cleaner, safer, faster transportation, America will not only help the environment but provide millions of good-paying middle-class jobs.
Whether you’re covered through your employer, on your own, or not at all - you should have a choice to buy into a public option health plan like Medicare.
The Affordable Care Act was a huge step forward for this country. Now we have to finish the job and make health care a right, not a privilege, and give everyone the peace of mind they deserve.
By making post-secondary education and training affordable to and making sure the economy works not only for folks with a four-year degree but also for those who complete on-the-job training and trade programs, too.
Twelve years of education is not enough. In order to rebuild a strong middle class, we must provide skills needed to do the jobs of the 21st Century.
We need to get rid of the capital gains loophole for multimillionaires. I’m going to change it so millionaires and billionaires don’t pay lower tax rates than teachers and firefighters. We need to reward work in this country, not just wealth.
Companies continue to squeeze every last penny out of workers, making it harder and harder for Americans to make ends meet. It’s way past time we make a $15 minimum wage the law of the land.
This country wasn’t built by Wall Street bankers and CEOs and hedge fund managers. It was built by you. The great American middle class. That’s the story of America and together we can rebuild the backbone of this nation.
As I shared in Pittsburgh today, there are three reasons I’m running for President - to restore the soul of our nation, rebuild its backbone - the middle class, and unify all Americans. If you stand with me, join our campaign: https://t.co/twQHMjvY7e
I'm sick of this President badmouthing unions. Labor built the middle class in this country. Minimum wage, overtime pay, the 40-hour week: they exist for all of us because unions fought for those rights. We need a President who honors them and their work.
I couldn't be more proud to have the International Association of Fire Fighters on my team. Unions built the middle class in this country—and as President, I'll fight to strengthen them and grow the backbone of this country. https://t.co/rsUEowyxz7
I've said it before and I'll say it again. To speak to the middle class, we need to reject the super PAC system. That's exactly what this campaign is doing. https://t.co/Jc46rdBbsh https://t.co/SeEfkmkSyx
Join me in Pittsburgh tomorrow for a discussion on my plan to build a middle class where everyone comes along. RSVP to let me know you’ll be there: https://t.co/WLKs9xmHM7
Iowa, I'm headed to town this week! Let me know you'll join us by RSVPing at https://t.co/NdJwunC2kP https://t.co/8i6GPQKV6x
Dick Lugar was among the most decent men I have ever known. Kind, loyal, dedicated beyond measure to the service of the American people. Dick Lugar was my dear friend. 

Jill and I send our condolences to his wife Charlene and the entire Lugar family.
Wishing everyone in the Orthodox Christian community a peaceful and joyful Easter celebration with friends, family and loved ones. God Bless.
Jill and I are devastated to hear about today’s shooting at the Chabad Poway synagogue. No one should have to worship in fear.

As a country, we must speak out against bigotry and gun violence. We’re in the battle for the soul of this nation—and it’s on all of us to act.
I have a message for #TeamJoe: Thank you! https://t.co/j61zCaZmDz
I had the privilege to thank one of our grassroots donors. It's because of supporters like Josh we're able to make this campaign a reality and bring this country together. https://t.co/afNTBQb4xB

The hard working men and women of @UFCW that I met today are going without pay during this strike. If you can, pitch in to make sure that those workers facing the greatest hardship are supported. https://t.co/49JkqJG1Cu
My wife Jill always reminds me that any country that out-educates us will out-compete us. Our teachers must have the resources they need &amp; the wages they deserve so that America will continue to lead the world. Great speech today on this from @rweingarten. https://t.co/aaU10GNjOB
I'm on my way up to a rally at #StopandShop in Boston to stand with some of the 31,000 @UFCW union members who are currently fighting against cuts to wages and health care for themselves and their families. Stand with us: https://t.co/D4baO7D5xH
For centuries, Notre Dame Cathedral has withstood wars, revolutions, and the test of time. It is a symbol of faith &amp; a testament to history. And even as our hearts break to see it burn today during the holiest week of the year for Catholics, I have faith that it will rise again.
This is powerful. I would encourage everyone to read and take to heart Kyle’s message on privilege. https://t.co/Kceif5wFvg
In the last 5 years, @StopandShop's parent company has bought back billions of dollars in stock. Now they want to cut employee wages &amp; benefits. This is wrong. I stand with the 31,000 @UFCW workers fighting for their healthcare. Join me and support them: https://t.co/D4baO7D5xH

I see that you are on the job and presidential, as always. https://t.co/j7wh3opXOv
Social norms are changing. I understand that, and I’ve heard what these women are saying. Politics to me has always been about making connections, but I will be more mindful about respecting personal space in the future. That’s my responsibility and I will meet it. https://t.co/Ya2mf5ODts
Stoning people to death for homosexuality or adultery is appalling and immoral. Every single person on earth is entitled to be treated with dignity and to live without fear. There is no excuse—not culture, not tradition—for this kind of hate and inhumanity. https://t.co/g208NzeS7l
.@NRA opposition to a full reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act is sickening. We must do more to protect victims of stalking and abuse. It makes no sense to allow those who perpetrated the abuse to have access to deadly firearms. We must stand up now for survivors.
Whether on the assembly line, at the grocery store checkout, or in the boardroom, every woman deserves to make every penny a man doing the same job makes. The #PaycheckFairnessAct will help us get there. Congratulations @rosadelauro and thank you for your leadership on this.
I was honored to meet Vlad and Adrianna tonight at the #BidenCourageAwards. These young people exemplify what @ItsOnUs is all about. I hope their bravery inspires more to take action to change our culture.

The people of Guatemala should be the ones to choose their next president. The stakes are high: promoting transparency, shared prosperity, and combating corruption. For this reason, the @TSEGuatemala needs to certify all eligible presidential candidates by the Sunday deadline.
Silence is complicity. Our children are listening. The time to speak out is now.
On behalf of Jill, myself, and all of the Bidens, our hearts go out to the community in Christchurch suffering from today’s senseless violence. Friday prayers for those who were gathered at their mosques has seen families torn apart by hate.
No one should live in fear of being fired, evicted from their home, or denied service in a restaurant just because of their gender identity or who they love. The #EqualityAct is long overdue, and will ensure LGBTQ Americans are treated with the dignity and respect they deserve.
https://t.co/SOZ9EUh854
Joe Boardman led @Amtrak through difficult times, taking over during the worst economic crisis since the Depression, and starting a modernization that will help deliver the 21st century rail system America deserves. My thoughts are with his wife Joanne and their family.
Each year on International Women’s Day, we reaffirm the straightforward truth that achieving the goal of full and equal rights for women is essential to the success of all our nations.

@CynthiaNixon You’re right, Cynthia. I was making a point in a foreign policy context, that under normal circumstances a Vice President wouldn’t be given a silent reaction on the world stage. 

But there is nothing decent about being anti-LGBTQ rights, and that includes the Vice President.
Notes are ready. Be sure to tune in at 3pm ET when I will sit down at @UDBidenSchool with author and historian @jmeacham to talk about his book “The Soul of America” and the state of our democracy today. https://t.co/3F6qAEE3qA https://t.co/irisDJmDLu
Foreign election interference is not only a serious threat to our democratic institutions, it’s a threat to our national security. Russia and other authoritarian regimes are actively seeking to try to change outcomes of our democratic elections, and we can’t allow that to happen. https://t.co/9hFF6sHCQ5
Today I congratulated President @IvanDuque on his successful visit to Washington. Maintaining strong bipartisan support for #Colombia is vitally important to meeting key security and economic challenges in the hemisphere, including humanitarian aid for refugees from #Venezuela.
Stand with survivors and advocates like @nguyen_amanda, @ZerlinaMaxwell, @ruthmglenn, @DavidsonJess22, @Mariska, and so many others. Reauthorize VAWA now.
There is nothing more powerful that Congress can do to help women, strengthen families, and save lives than reauthorizing VAWA. Now.
VAWA’s power is that it gets stronger with each reauthorization. This year can be no different. Like was done in 2000 and 2005 and 2013, we must expand the reach of VAWA to respond to the needs of survivors at risk every day.
One in five women will still be victims of rape or attempted rape in their lifetimes. On average, three women a day are murdered by their husbands or boyfriends. Nothing is more urgent than reauthorizing and expanding the law that makes women safer.
Since the passage of VAWA, annual rates of domestic violence have dropped by 63%. The National Domestic Violence Hotline responds to more than 26,000 people a month, creating a safety net for survivors. We have made progress, but there is much more to do. Right now.
When I wrote the Violence Against Women Act in 1994, I believed it would be a lifeline. But this Congress has turned it into a political football. It’s time to pass a strong reauthorization to the Violence Against Women Act. No more stalling. Lives are on the line.
I know from personal experience the only way to overcome grief is to find purpose. The Parkland students &amp; families will not allow us to turn away from our responsibilities to those 17 fallen angels. We aren’t there yet, but with their determination &amp; insistence, we’ll get there.
One year after the tragic massacre in Parkland, we’ve not done nearly enough to ensure this will never happen again. In the last year far too many have died from gun violence. But I have hope. #MSDStrong
Only a tyrant would prevent the delivery of food and medicine to people he claims to lead. The international community must support Juan Guaido and the National Assembly. It is time for Maduro to step aside and allow a democratic transition. The Venezuelan people deserve better.
John Dingell was the Dean of the House. He earned that title — not just because he was there the longest — but because he led with great moral courage and vision. He was a friend and I will miss him terribly. Debbie is in my prayers.
Stacey Abrams achieved in a matter of minutes something Donald Trump failed to do in over an hour -- to embrace and give voice to the spirit and core values that make America great.
Today far too many transgender youth continue to face rejection at home and discrimination in their communities. Check out the work @bidenfoundation is doing with @lgbtmap and @genderspectrum to support these young people: https://t.co/TxMLXge8vh

There is no place for racism in America. Governor Northam has lost all moral authority and should resign immediately, Justin Fairfax is the leader Virginia needs now.
This country is built on the courage of ordinary Americans who stand up for what’s right. I couldn’t be prouder to stand alongside the young leaders fighting tooth and nail to protect Title IX.
Through the #HandsOffIX website, @endrapeoncampus,@knowyourIX have helped thousands make their voices heard in the notice and comment process. https://t.co/EBBlWMQ5ex
Fellow @UDelaware Blue Hen @Sage_Gaea of @knowyourIX has done so much for the students of Delaware through her advocacy, and is now fighting for students across the country.

Students and survivors are making their voices heard. Grassroots organizers are working to make sure these guidelines are never put into effect.
This week @bidenfoundation submitted a comment to the Department of Education about proposed changes to #TitleIX guidance.

These new rules would endanger students and make it harder for survivors of sexual assault to seek justice. https://t.co/qEV7z3Ewpx
What happened today to @JussieSmollett must never be tolerated in this country. We must stand up and demand that we no longer give this hate safe harbor; that homophobia and racism have no place on our streets or in our hearts. We are with you, Jussie. https://t.co/o8ilPu68CM
https://t.co/iYah5x11To
An untested rape kit means a survivor without justice. I wrote the first rape kit backlog law because every survivor deserves closure, and because evidence shows testing kits can identify men who have committed multiple rapes - and might again. Test every kit. Every single one.
Congratulations to the two women who led the way: @RepLonghurst and @HansenForSenate, as well as all of the lawmakers, activists, and citizens who made this happen.
“Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged on account of sex.” 

Another step forward for equality and basic dignity in Delaware tonight, as the Equal Rights Amendment is enshrined in our state’s Constitution.

I know I’m a little biased, but this post from Jill @DrBiden in the #BidenForum is a must-read. Her story of the strong middle-class values that shaped her is America’s story. And she tells it so well. https://t.co/RbsmCOGRv5
It is clear this administration has abandoned those core American beliefs. Secretary Mattis’ presence and his voice of reason and experience will be missed in the Pentagon and the Situation Room.
I’ve had disagreements with Secretary Mattis, but we shared the view — long-held by Democrats and Republicans in this nation — that respect for our allies and a commitment to the most important and effective alliances in history made America safer.
Friends don't let friends go uninsured. If you still need health insurance for 2019, tomorrow, December 15th, is the last day to get it through https://t.co/2Ls3d80By6. This is about your health and peace of mind for you and your loved ones — there's nothing more important. https://t.co/hnXCRbOiOZ
This summer, the @bidenfoundation asked you to share stories about the importance of family and community acceptance for #LGBTQ young people. Here’s what you’ve said so far: https://t.co/o3NTnmNzH1

President George H.W. Bush was a decent, kind, and gracious statesman. This nation will miss him. Our condolences go out to the entire Bush family for their loss. https://t.co/vF2qRPm4by
Grateful for the time spent with loved ones this Thanksgiving, and grateful for the sacrifice of those military families whose loved ones are on duty, unable to be with their families. From our family to yours, Happy Thanksgiving.
Betsy DeVos’ new Title IX rules will discourage sexual assault reporting and investigations. When 1 in 5 women experience sexual assault while in college, we can’t afford to go backwards. Share your views: https://t.co/eSsO7c9yXD
The fires continue to burn in California, and our firefighters are among those who are losing everything. Right now, no matter where you live, you can help. Please give to support firefighters who have lost their homes to the wildfires: https://t.co/BwM7gzZAjw
Instead of saying every legal vote should be counted in Florida, Republicans have adopted a strategy to discredit the process. 

It’s wrong – and it’s dangerous. 

Count every single lawful vote. Count them fairly. Count them transparently. https://t.co/9pANgOv2dY
Congratulations to @kyrstensinema for a well-earned victory tonight. She’s going to do incredible work for Arizona. Credit to @MarthaMcSally as well for handling the results with true dignity and class.
Every military family knows what it means to sacrifice. Every individual life and story matters. It is who we are as Americans. 

On #VeteransDay and every day we must stand up for the men and women who put their lives on the line to defend us.
It’s the most fundamental American right: the right to vote — and for your vote to be counted. Count all the votes in Florida, Georgia, and Arizona. Count them fairly. Count them transparently.
There's still time to take this election into your own hands. Don't regret what you could have done—take action right now: https://t.co/hPaGx4kLyA
No better time to help get out the vote than right now—whether you have a lunch break or a few hours to spare, take back our democracy at an event near you: https://t.co/hPaGx4kLyA

You don’t need to be a Vice President or a podcast star to to make a difference in this election. 

Volunteer now, knock on some doors, and make sure you show up to vote this Tuesday. https://t.co/ErWycs1ORg
Voting restrictions in Georgia weren’t meant to protect the sanctity of our vote, but to suppress turnout. I applaud the court rulings to overturn them and right these wrongs. 

We should be making voting easier, not harder. Now let’s prove nothing can stop us. Vote. https://t.co/utgGhoJzGQ
The character of our country is on the ballot on Tuesday, but you still have a chance to make a difference today. Don't just vote -- volunteer on #TheLastWeekend. It's that important. https://t.co/nw9I8WfFK1 https://t.co/0mvuVFh9aX

Cancer patients own their data, not hospitals. #CountMeIn empowers patients to contribute their data for research. To find cures.

Our basic American values are under assault. But we can take this country back if we show up and vote.

20 years have passed since the murder of young Matthew Shepard. We've come a long way, thanks to organizations like @MattShepardFDN, but our work isn’t done. We cannot stop fighting until every LGBTQ young person is affirmed, supported, and safe. #MSF20
Joe Tydings and I were both inspired by JFK &amp; RFK and their call to service. In the Senate, he lived up to their example with an ironclad commitment to fight the abuse of power and work to ensure that every American gets a fair shot. Joe made America better—he will be missed.
Jason - public service takes many forms, and bravely stepping forward today is exactly that. By sharing your story, you are saving lives. Others will get the help they need because of you. 

Jill and I, and all of the Bidens, are with you, Diana, and True every step of the way. https://t.co/owsPjvsigd
Dr. James Allison and Dr. Tasuku Honjo’s immunotherapy discovery uses our own body’s defenses to destroy cancer. Today’s @NobelPrize award is a significant leap toward ending cancer as we know it and paving the path to a cure. Congratulations and thank you.

In the wake of darker moments in our history, our spirit has become mightier. The bonds that unite us have become thicker.
 
Seventeen years after the 9/11 attacks, may we continue to live that legacy in our words and our deeds, every day. In America, we can overcome anything.
Before we vote this fall in the most consequential election of any of our lifetimes, I want us to have a real discussion about what really matters: the fundamental issues that determine whether or not all of us are given a chance to live with dignity and to pursue opportunity. https://t.co/Mz2Rx5iYE5
Inspiring words from @BarackObama today.  A powerful reminder that it's on all of us to vote this fall if we want leaders who reflect the civility, character, dignity, and goodness of the American people. The stakes couldn't be higher, but Americans always rise to the occasion.
If there was ever a time for a change of pace, it is now. I recommend giving Michael’s new podcast a listen. https://t.co/Ju2AgDdohi
Organized labor is why we have a minimum wage in this country. It’s why we have the five-day work week. It’s why we have worker safety standards. It’s why we have a middle class in America. We owe them. https://t.co/s8vdvVs4dp
Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales’s decision to end CICIG’s mandate represents a serious blow to anti-corruption efforts in the hemisphere.

John McCain was many things – a proud graduate of the Naval Academy, a Senate colleague, a political opponent. 

But, to me, more than anything, John was a friend. He will be missed dearly. https://t.co/AS8YsMLw3d
Leonard and Dody Boswell lived their lives in service to the people of Iowa, and for the last 63 of those years, in loving dedication to each other. We remember both of them today as they are laid to rest. https://t.co/LWJmFZxvWE
We’re in the midst of an all-out assault on human dignity—yes, at the border, but also in the courtroom, in the classroom, and on the factory floor. https://t.co/ksVyLe7N7S
Kofi Annan knew that human beings acting together could make the world better. He dedicated his life to that belief. He insisted that defending human rights and dignity were part of our responsibilities to one another. We are all better for his influence on our world.
The team @LombardiCancer has just made a valuable database of brain cancer biomedical data freely available to researchers globally. We need efforts like this to advance progress against cancer. https://t.co/mdkF3nBIYi
Aretha Franklin was so much more than a great entertainer. She inspired. She gave hope. She was part of the soul of the civil rights movement. We won't see her like again.
In the time I have known him, John Brennan has never been afraid to speak up and give it to you straight. Revoking his security clearance is an act unbecoming of a President. If you think it will silence John, then you just don't know the man.
Today we honor the memory of Heather Heyer, whose spirit we see in every person who stands up to reject hatred and bigotry. Make no mistake: this fight goes on. The battle for the soul of this nation rests with each of us, everyday.
Paul Laxalt was the model for something all too rare in politics today: someone with whom you could disagree without being disagreeable. We were often on opposite sides of the debate, but he was my friend. He will be missed. https://t.co/dlVvYomwRz
LGBTQ young people should never have to face rejection from those who love them. Share your story with @bidenfoundation about the importance of family acceptance, because we all deserve to be safe, loved, and affirmed. #AsYouAre

Our president had the chance to confront an adversary who continues to attack our democracy &amp; our allies. He didn’t. Instead he offered distractions, moral equivalence, &amp; appeasement. This shameful performance doesn't represent the US or what we stand for: https://t.co/tsc0lOV8b8
After our video chat a few months ago, I got to welcome @shaffer_cierra to DC this week for @USMC Sunset Parade. She battled against cancer’s odds and her resilience reminds us all that hope against this disease is real. #cancerFIERCE https://t.co/2s9LcfhdIc
As we celebrate 242 years of freedom this week, we must never forget that democracy is not a given. Democracy demands diligence. Democracy demands engagement. And sometimes, democracy demands sacrifice of its citizens. https://t.co/0NelFhacoF
Keep our eyes on the horizon - look to the future. Nothing is beyond our capacity as Americans. Happy #FourthofJuly from the Biden Family.
We need more men like @terrycrews who will stand up and speak out. You’re helping change the culture, Terry. It matters. Thank you. https://t.co/wbOsMjEBuG
It’s up to us, America. Speak out. Rise up. Be heard. The price to be paid for putting our values at risk must be clear. Now. 

And show up to vote this November—in numbers like we’ve never seen.
Advice and consent. Absent that—which we’ve always had for nominees in election years in the past—we shouldn’t move forward with hearings or a vote before the mid-term elections.
I wish this Senate would force a consensus choice—as we did with Justice Kennedy—it no longer has the will.
I wish this President would engage in conversations and nominate a consensus candidate. That’s what we’ve done in the past. That’s what America needs and deserves. He won’t.
I said a year ago we’re living through a battle for the soul of this nation. Now there can be no doubt. Roe, Obergefell, Fisher, and more—so many of our fundamental rights, freedoms, and liberties—and the rule of law—are all at risk.
Inspired by the patients, families, clinicians, and researchers of @stjuderesearch I met earlier this month. They are making hope real. Join us and let us know about your #cancerFIERCE story. https://t.co/YONYdf0tpY https://t.co/WSRAI7sBRn
We don’t need to treat migrants from Central America with cruelty to strengthen US border security. We need personal, high-level engagement from the White House to press Northern Triangle leaders for progress and support to make their home countries prosperous and secure. https://t.co/ATrg1NXC4m
A policy that separates young children from their parents isn’t a “deterrent”. It’s unconscionable.

PEPFAR is one of the most successful, effective, and world-changing initiatives the United States has ever led. Now is not the time to pull back. We must finish the work we started to end the specter of AIDS. My op-ed with @bfrist. https://t.co/nnIc0YvDoz
Jamie Dimon &amp; Warren Buffett's call to end quarterly guidance is an important step toward ending our nation's culture of short-termism. America's workers &amp; investors will all be better off with a system that rewards those who build for the long-term. https://t.co/yvtwMPWabm
GOP all-out assault on healthcare continues. First, they want to cut funding for CHIP. Now DOJ trying to end protections for pre-existing conditions. We have to fight back.
Putin’s Russia invaded its neighbors, violated our sovereignty by undermining elections, and attacks dissidents abroad. Yet our President wants to reward him with a seat at the table while alienating our closest democratic allies. It makes no sense.
They may have murdered our heroes, but the dream still lives buried deep in our broken hearts. Fifty years after he was taken from us, Robert Kennedy still inspires. #RFK50
Last year, Virginians showed up to elect leaders who believe health care is a right, not a privilege. As a result, hundreds of thousands of Virginians now have the peace of mind that comes with health insurance. Don't ever question whether your vote matters -- it does. Show up.

Today, the @OECD officially invited Colombia to become its 37th member.  Congratulations to President @JuanManSantos and the people of Colombia for all the hard work you’ve done to create a more prosperous and secure future for your country.
It favors the powerful over the powerless and stacks the deck even further against working people.  It's wrong.
Yesterday’s Supreme Court decision was a huge blow to workers.  It denies them the ability to take their employers to court if they're being cheated out of pay, forced to work in unsafe conditions, or sexually harrassed.
Everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, but too many LGBTQ Americans are still denied this basic right. That’s why I’m proud to announce a new inclusion initiative between @bidenfoundation and @YMCA. The work continues: https://t.co/Qi20gM6TXp

My mother often reminded me that “bravery resides in every heart and some day it will be summoned.” Lt. Col. Arnaud Beltrame answered the call last Friday in France. Taking the place of a hostage and paying the ultimate price. His heroism and self-sacrifice must not be forgotten.

Louise Slaughter was an unparalleled champion for women. I worked with her on the Violence Against Women Act, and I will always remember her grit and determination in standing up for women and families every day. She will be greatly missed.
The people of Pennsylvania’s 18th district showed up yesterday. They demonstrated that they want to be represented by someone who stands up for working people with actions, not just words. Who has heart. They found that in @ConorLambPA. He will represent them well.
I was in southwestern Pennsylvania with @ConorLambPA last week. Something's changing out there. You can feel the grassroots energy. And that'll beat big money every time. Let's bring this one home. Get out and vote, Pennsylvania. https://t.co/Rl9EO2Ok5d

We need to give young immigrants who came to our country as children permanent assurance that they are safe here, and we need to give them this peace of mind now. They shouldn’t have to spend another day living with fear and uncertainty.
When I wrote the Violence Against Women Act in 1994, it included a provision that empowered women to take abusers to civil court. The Supreme Court wrongly struck it down. Now it is time for Congress to step up and fix this. https://t.co/bzgD80sULc
Rev. Graham was spiritual advisor to a dozen Presidents - and countless millions of Americans. We remember his example of dignity and humility today, and Jill and I send our thoughts and condolences to the entire Graham family.
I am at a loss for what more to say. I grieve with the families in Parkland today. I grieve with the families across the country who have suffered loss due to gun violence. Congress has a moral obligation to take action and spare more families from this violence.
We need to believe women like Colbie. We need to recognize the incredible courage it takes for women like her to come forward. And we need to change the culture so those who live in fear can safely get the support they deserve. https://t.co/aIE49mOU0K

Every week, we’ll hear from leaders in business, politics, academics—and everyday Americans sharing bright ideas that keep us moving forward.
Today I’m announcing the launch of the Biden Forum, a new space for conversations about America’s future: https://t.co/RS1zFw4Psk https://t.co/XT731eD6ta
Today, on the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, let's remember all the work that remains and recommit ourselves to action: https://t.co/BEOky10g2H
Thank you to the #AmericanPromiseTour moderators and thousands of readers who attended events or picked up a copy of #PromiseMeDad. Honored to be able to share the story of my son Beau, and what a remarkable man he was. https://t.co/Y7IzxKqXtV https://t.co/Qp0l3qTJTz

You’re going to make us all proud, Danica. https://t.co/doouBh0qME
Juanita Perez Williams ran an incredible campaign in Syracuse. So proud of the work she did. And still hoping for a win for Manka Dhingra that will change the shape of Washington’s state Senate!
And mayors like Rick Kriseman and Joyce Craig who are incredible leaders in their communities.
State legislators like Sara Cambensy in Michigan and Danica Roem, Jennifer Carroll Foy, David Reid, John Bell, and Elizabeth Guzman in Virginia. People who stood up for working people of every stripe.
Candidates like Ralph Northam and Justin Fairfax, who will ensure that Virginia’s economic recovery continues to reach every town and city in the commonwealth.
A resounding defeat tonight for President Trump. Voters around the country rejected the ugly politics we have seen this past year. Instead, they chose candidates who unite and inspire us.
Folks, there's an election happening tomorrow. We've got to keep our eye on the ball. Let's get this done. https://t.co/UWl53fswMz

23 years ago today, the Violence Against Women Act became law. VAWA is changing the culture &amp; saving lives, but our work continues. #VAWA23
16 years ago today, terror tried to break us. It did not, and will never, succeed. Our grit &amp; determination are the strongest force I know.

Thank you to everyone who tirelessly worked to protect the health care of millions. You saved lives.
To all of you working to stop Republicans’ devastating “health” bill: Thank you. We’re not done yet. Please keep going.
Any final bill that looks anything like their proposals so far would be devastating.
Every patriotic American who is qualified to serve in our military should be able to serve. Full stop.
The GOP's health plan would gut care &amp; treatment for opioid addiction. Call your senators—the time to act is now. https://t.co/ZHX7KZLgXk
Incredible progress in cancer research and treatment in just the last year offers new promise and new hope. You can win this fight, John.
John and I have been friends for 40 years. He's gotten through so much difficulty with so much grace. He is strong - and he will beat this.
@washingtonpost I was a senator for 36 years. I can assure you that your call matters. Your viewpoint might not always win, but your senators hear you.
@washingtonpost Especially if you live in WV, NV, AK or OH now is the time to call your senators. Or, encourage your friends in these states to call.
@washingtonpost If you believe health care is a right for all, make sure your senators know that this bill is a big step backward.
@washingtonpost All Americans deserve the peace of mind that comes with knowing that you can get affordable care. But that’s now under threat.
@washingtonpost By denying this right, Republican leadership’s “health” bill is fundamentally flawed. It can’t even be fixed on the floor.
@washingtonpost Republican leadership's “health” bill would return us to a time when health care was a privilege for the wealthy, not a right for all.
Today, I wrote in the @washingtonpost about the big problem with the Republican leadership’s health bill: https://t.co/GYCeXPhWdX
Excited to share news about #AmericanPromiseTour - a series of conversations I’m hosting around the country https://t.co/Y7IzxKqXtV https://t.co/lpVu14LZsZ
Jill &amp; I send our condolences to the loved ones of service members lost in MS crash—those who wear the uniform are the heart of our nation.
Happy 4th of July! America continues the march toward tolerance, diversity and equality of opportunity that began in 1776—that's patriotism.
We’re live in a few minutes to talk about how @BidenCancer will bring renewed urgency to the fight against cancer: https://t.co/1rcV1XdLmS
Jill and I are excited and ready to take the next step toward ending cancer. Are you with us? https://t.co/vVDk81oRtq
Let's see a bill that actually tries to improve folks' health care, and then we can have a reasonable debate about how to best do that.
Especially now, when so many communities are struggling with opioid addiction, the bill's drastic cuts to Medicaid are cruel.
Slashing Medicaid hurts kids, the elderly, people with disabilities and those struggling with addiction. All for tax breaks for the wealthy.
The Senate health bill isn't about health care at all—it's a wealth transfer: slashes care to fund tax cuts for the wealthy &amp; corporations.
America’s soul is rooted in the promise of opportunity. We must protect, support &amp; welcome refugees to keep that promise. #WorldRefugeeDay https://t.co/4K3exquxgl
Jill and I are praying for the people of Colombia and the families of the victims of tonight's bomb explosion. #BogotaEstoyContigo

Honored to see Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew in Athens – his leadership on climate change and the environment is the example we need now https://t.co/VO2zdVc3Gc
Great to be with @PennBiden in Athens. A Europe whole, free, &amp; at peace remains vital to U.S. security–as it has been for the past 7 decades
Congrats to Ambassador Andy Young, a dear friend and inspiration, on 85 years. Wish I could be in Atlanta tonight for AJY Leadership Awards.
We're already feeling impacts of climate change. Exiting #ParisAgreement imperils US security and our ability to own the clean energy future
It's time for big dreams and #AmericanPossibilities. If you're ready to elect folks who agree, say you're in: https://t.co/HyJR0b0KxA https://t.co/nmvlgZfKYN
There’s no one better positioned on Earth to lead the world in the 21st century than America. We just have to believe it.
America is at its best when we’re OPTIMISTIC and we THINK BIG.
It’s time to remember who we are as Americans: Giving EVERYONE the opportunity to achieve the impossible.
Our politics has become too small and petty. We’re better than this.
America has always thought BIG. It’s stamped into our DNA.
Climate change is an existential threat to our future—staying in #ParisAgreement is the best way to protect our children &amp; global leadership
To our nation's fallen troops: we thank you and will never forget. To their families: remember, you are never alone.
Zbigniew Brzezinski's brilliant strategic mind enriched American foreign policy for decades--his distinctive voice will be greatly missed.
Great to see Mayor @marty_walsh, and hear about everything he's doing to keep Boston strong. https://t.co/U74RGLciBb
LGBT rights are human rights. Prejudice is prejudice; inhumanity is inhumanity.  #IDAHOT #IDAHOT2017 https://t.co/XyAWDqAtAJ
Millions of Americans will lose coverage. Up to the Senate now. Hoping for courage to return.
Day of shame in Congress. Protections for pre-existing conditions, mental health, maternity care, addiction services -- all gone.
Dan Rooney embodied everything I was raised to believe being Irish meant – generosity, decency, warmth, dignity &amp; a truly genuine spirit.
Boston represents what it means to never yield, never cower, never stand down &amp; lead the way. America owns the finish line. #OneBostonDay
When faced with crimes of hate and inhumanity, every person of conscience must speak out in support of #LGBT rights https://t.co/crzQTFQKmS
