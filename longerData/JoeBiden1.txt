Joe Biden tweeted: The choice between the economy and public health is a false one—if we don’t beat the virus, we'll never get back to full economic strength and will lose countless lives.

Joe Biden tweeted: Donald Trump seems to think he can direct funding based on which politicians are nice to him, which states he’s trying to win in November, and which businesses he wants to enrich — all without any accountability. @EWarren and I think that’s unacceptable. https://t.co/wbEcnkBzj1
Joe Biden tweeted: This #WorldPressFreedomDay, support for an independent press at home and around the world matters more than ever. We must vote Trump out this November and assure that attacks on our free press are never again acceptable — especially not in the White House. https://t.co/Ga8zWYphOg
Joe Biden tweeted: Trump deflects legitimate questions with attacks. He bullies members of the press, instead of taking responsibility for his failures. His efforts to undermine public confidence in the integrity of reporting violate our core values and threaten our very system of government.
Joe Biden tweeted: A free press is essential to a free society. That's why attacking the press and attempting to intimidate independent media is a standard part of the authoritarian playbook around the world. And it’s why Donald Trump’s efforts to demonize the media put us on such a dangerous path.

Joe Biden tweeted: I'll say what Donald Trump won't: The Confederate flag, swastikas, and other symbols of hate that have been used in these protests have no place in America.

Joe Biden tweeted: To Bernie and Jane, as friends, from Jill and me: You haven’t just run a political campaign; you’ve created a movement. And make no mistake about it, we believe it’s a movement that is as powerful today as it was yesterday. That’s a good thing for our nation and our future.
Joe Biden tweeted: I know Bernie well. He’s a good man, a great leader, and one of the most powerful voices for change in our country. And it’s hard to sum up his contributions to our politics in one, single tweet. So I won’t try to. https://t.co/Z6OkCDWFNm

Joe Biden tweeted: We’re starting to see evidence that long-term exposure to air pollution—which disproportionately affects communities of color &amp; low-income communities—is linked to COVID-19 death rates.

Joe Biden tweeted: The character of the American people is on full display across the country. In the middle of a crisis, folks are stepping up and doing what they can to help out those in need. The Angeleno Campaign, led by my friend Mayor @EricGarcetti, is a great example of the work being done. https://t.co/eo8GGH6hmG
Joe Biden tweeted: The American people are rising to meet this moment. We need our president to do the same.
Joe Biden tweeted: Let me be very clear: No one is expendable. No matter your age, race, gender, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or disability.
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: No life is worth losing to add one more point to the Dow.
Joe Biden tweeted: President Trump says no one saw this coming, but that’s just not true. Our own intelligence officials were warning of the coronavirus threat back in January. Trump ignored them, and now we’re paying the price. https://t.co/HCNDWim5Oc
Joe Biden tweeted: As Americans, we may be physically apart, but we are truly all in this together. When we have stood as one, this nation has never been defeated. And we are not going to be defeated now. https://t.co/T3pFw3DQlj
Joe Biden tweeted: Let me be clear: Donald Trump knew about the threat the coronavirus posed and failed to act. It’s one of the most unjustifiable failures of presidential leadership in American history. https://t.co/l8BdATZsaL
Joe Biden tweeted: The stakes in this election couldn’t be higher. Donald Trump is wholly unfit to lead this nation — and that has become even clearer in the last few weeks. We have to vote him out of the White House.
Joe Biden tweeted: It has been a month since this tweet. https://t.co/19C5oY2YSg
Joe Biden tweeted: I know we are up to this challenge. The American people are strong, tough, brave, and big-hearted. We can and will overcome this — together.
Joe Biden tweeted: As this public health crisis rages, with the economy in peril, and with front line workers putting their lives at risk — Trump and Republican Attorneys-General are attempting to strip health insurance away from millions.
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: No more games. Drop this lawsuit. Save lives. https://t.co/aSgzVzOvlV
Joe Biden tweeted: In January, Donald Trump claimed the coronavirus was “totally under control.”
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: In February, he said it would disappear.
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: Now, he’s saying it “could’ve been stopped pretty easily if we had known.”
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: Donald Trump knew. He failed to act. And now we’re paying the price.
Joe Biden tweeted: Across the country, there are incredible stories of folks stepping up to help their neighbors, stories like this one. It's who we are as Americans. Brave and big-hearted. Always willing to lend a hand and care for those in need.
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: We will overcome this, together. https://t.co/qeNUK1y5fx
Joe Biden tweeted: Where are the tests?
Joe Biden tweeted: Where are the masks?
Joe Biden tweeted: Where are the ventilators?
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: The American people deserve answers, Mr. President. https://t.co/N2MWYKOzOu
Joe Biden tweeted: Obamacare was a big deal — and that still holds true a decade later. On its tenth anniversary, we need to double down on our efforts to protect it from Donald Trump's attacks and build on it to ensure every American receives the care they need. https://t.co/aXqHL7LN9f
Joe Biden tweeted: A $500 billion slush fund for corporations with almost no conditions is unacceptable. We have to ensure the help these companies receive goes to their workers — not their CEOs.
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: It's time for President Trump and Mitch McConnell to put American families first. https://t.co/SWU2bLhCGj
Joe Biden tweeted: During a public health crisis, it's unconscionable that Donald Trump and others are continuing a lawsuit designed to strip millions of people of their health insurance. This morning, I called on them to drop the lawsuit and protect Americans' health care. https://t.co/PlfeFNwhG2
Joe Biden tweeted: What is President Trump waiting for? 
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: Health care workers don't have enough masks to keep themselves safe.
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: Hospitals are running low on ventilators that sick Americans could literally need to breathe.
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: He needs to act now to deliver these essential supplies. Lives depend on it. https://t.co/du94NRJ0YI
Joe Biden tweeted: I'm about to deliver remarks on the Coronavirus pandemic. Tune in to watch live: https://t.co/HpaqlEb7D1
Joe Biden tweeted: President Trump and Mitch McConnell are trying to put a corporate bailout ahead of families. It's simply wrong. We need to be focused on helping hardworking Americans, communities, and small businesses — not handing big corporations a blank check. https://t.co/tMBZm26h3y
Joe Biden tweeted: It’s simple: President Trump and Mitch McConnell are trying to put corporate bailouts ahead of families. And it’s wrong. Hardworking, struggling Americans should come first — not the big corporations looking for a blank check. https://t.co/pxGrnTYebF
Joe Biden tweeted: President Trump’s dithering on preparing us for this global pandemic and his lies about his response to this dangerous crisis is one of the most unjustifiable failures of presidential leadership in American history. 
Joe Biden tweeted: https://t.co/pFIoZCJWmH
Joe Biden tweeted: In this moment of crisis, we should be sending federal resources to those who need it most. It's not just good economics — it's the right thing to do. We have to get this right.
Joe Biden tweeted: We should also increase monthly Social Security checks by $200/month, as proposed by Senator Wyden and colleagues. Seniors and people with disabilities are uniquely at risk right now.
Joe Biden tweeted: Additionally, we should forgive a minimum of $10,000/person of federal student loans, as proposed by Senator Warren and colleagues. Young people and other student debt holders bore the brunt of the last crisis. It shouldn't happen again.
Joe Biden tweeted: On March 6th, Donald Trump claimed: “Anybody that wants a test can get a test.”
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: That was a flat-out lie then, and it’s still not true today. It’s a disgrace.
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: We need to ensure everyone who needs a test can get one free of charge. Period.
Joe Biden tweeted: No bill should pass without immediate, generous relief for workers who are losing jobs and hours, small businesses losing revenue, and communities facing emergency needs.
Joe Biden tweeted: No bill should pass without conditions on corporations to ensure the help they get goes to their workers, not their CEOs. No blank checks.
Joe Biden tweeted: It's simple: The White House and @senatemajldr have tried to put corporate bailouts ahead of families. https://t.co/mFsPjmlbHW
Joe Biden tweeted: We owe a debt of gratitude to the first responders, health care providers, grocery and retail workers, transportation workers, public safety officials, and everyone working around the clock to keep our country running. Thank you, thank you, thank you for all you’re doing.
Joe Biden tweeted: In times of crisis, a president should calm and heal, lead the way with a steady hand, and provide a beacon of hope for the American people.
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: Donald Trump is incapable of doing that. https://t.co/0I7ZYNtqCV
Joe Biden tweeted: We need action, not more empty words from President Trump. It’s time for him to step up and do his job. https://t.co/TBpXhoAg1P
Joe Biden tweeted: Donald Trump has failed the American people. https://t.co/HsNl9M4h4r
Joe Biden tweeted: Everyone knows that we're facing a real crisis from the coronavirus. But do you know how we got here and what we need to do next? Ron Klain, former White House Ebola Response Coordinator, breaks it down for us: https://t.co/XRkIw2EzM4
Joe Biden tweeted: The coronavirus test should be made widely available and free.
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: The coronavirus vaccine, when ready, should be made widely available and free.
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: Treatment for coronavirus should be free, too.
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: We're in a crisis. No one should have to pay for their coronavirus health care costs.
Joe Biden tweeted: From day one, the goal of our campaign has been to unite the country — and in times of crisis, that goal is more important than ever. If we come together and all do our part, we will overcome this. I promise.
Joe Biden tweeted: The president has been behind the curve throughout this whole response. He’s talking about yesterday rather than where we need to be tomorrow. The president needs to stop talking and start rallying government action with the urgency and ambition this moment demands.
Joe Biden tweeted: Now he’s switched to falsely telling us that he’s taking action that he has not taken, and promising results that he’s not delivering. People are scared. They're frightened. And their president is just exacerbating their concerns.
Joe Biden tweeted: In times of crisis, the American people deserve a president who tells them the truth and takes responsibility. Donald Trump has not been that president. For months, he falsely told us we had nothing to worry about while praising China’s response for managing the coronavirus.
Joe Biden tweeted: If you have a minute, read these stories of folks coming together and helping out their neighbors. They represent who we are as Americans. In times of crisis, we stand as one. We look out for each other. And that’s how we’ll get through this — together. https://t.co/rardKq7Dtd
Joe Biden tweeted: The President says no one cares about being tested.
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: Have you or a loved one had trouble getting tested? https://t.co/WrFcgCtriA
Joe Biden tweeted: Getting money quickly to families is the right goal, but Senate Republicans are proposing to send significantly lower amounts to low-income families than those with higher incomes. That’s terrible economics &amp; terrible values. We should be targeting help to those who need it most. https://t.co/J0tS9K7c9Y
Joe Biden tweeted: The lack of coronavirus testing in the U.S. is a national disgrace. https://t.co/kD9cEFtAUR
Joe Biden tweeted: The least we can do for every grocery and retail worker working around the clock during this crisis is to provide a $15 minimum wage, paid sick leave, and strong workplace protections.
Joe Biden tweeted: Every CEO in America should be focusing on workers, families, and communities — not executive compensation and share prices.
Joe Biden tweeted: I am calling on every CEO in America to publicly commit now to not buying back their company's stock over the course of the next year. As workers face the physical and economic consequences of the coronavirus, our corporate leaders cannot cede responsibility for their employees.
Joe Biden tweeted: .@SenGillibrand has never been afraid to speak without fear, to be brave in the face of injustice, and to empower others to get off the sidelines. I'm thrilled and honored to have her support. https://t.co/3DWCZnsnqB
Joe Biden tweeted: The words of a president matter, and Donald Trump has used his to downplay COVID-19 and mislead the American people. He is unfit to lead us through this crisis. https://t.co/s7tnaR4G7p
Joe Biden tweeted: This administration is truly morally bankrupt. https://t.co/aUCRMbLsoS
Joe Biden tweeted: Every worker on the front lines of the fight against COVID-19 deserves protections and accommodations that keep them and their families safe. I'm glad to see states stepping up to support folks — employers must do the same. https://t.co/QClURuStbV
Joe Biden tweeted: My prayers go out to all those on the front lines of this crisis. https://t.co/KfNNRsdS7I
Joe Biden tweeted: Doctors and nurses are making their own makeshift face masks today as they risk their lives to care for others. What other finding do you need to see to convince you to use every power you have to expand our supply of essential equipment, Mr. President?
Joe Biden tweeted: Yesterday, President Trump said he was invoking the Defense Production Act, then turned around and said he wasn't planning to use it. The President should exercise these powers now. We need more ventilators, protective equipment, and critical supplies. We need action, not words.
Joe Biden tweeted: .@TulsiGabbard has put her life on the line in service of this country and continues to serve with honor today. I’m grateful to have her support and look forward to working with her to restore honor and decency to the White House.
Joe Biden tweeted: This is a moment to look out for our neighbors, care for the elderly, and thank the workers on the front lines of this fight. This is a moment to believe in one another.
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: When we do that, when we see the best in each of us, we’ll lift this nation up and get through this together.
Joe Biden tweeted: The Obama-Biden Administration set up the White House National Security Council Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense to prepare for future pandemics like COVID-19.
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: Donald Trump eliminated it — and now we're paying the price.
Joe Biden tweeted: Our campaign is building the broad coalition we need to win in November. https://t.co/cINCXLJnn0
Joe Biden tweeted: I give you my word as a Biden: When I'm president, I will lead with science, listen to the experts and heed their advice, and always tell you the truth. https://t.co/tIpjW1ch0L
Joe Biden tweeted: It is a national disgrace that millions of Americans do not have a single day of paid sick leave.
Joe Biden tweeted: I know the American people have the capacity to meet this moment. There’s nothing we’ve been unable to accomplish if we do it together.
Joe Biden tweeted: Stop the xenophobic fear-mongering. Be honest. Take responsibility. Do your job. https://t.co/nQ5aLVrpyb
Joe Biden tweeted: Much has been made of changes in President Trump's tone in recent days. But with our health care system at risk, a virus spreading, our economy on the brink — and so many lives at stake — it’s time to be less interested in his words and more focused on his actions — or inaction. https://t.co/txoIVUWxTO
Joe Biden tweeted: In times of crisis, Americans stand as one. Volunteers raise their hands to help. Neighbors look out for neighbors. Businesses take care of their workers. That's who we are.
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: We can and will meet this challenge — together. https://t.co/xGcTQuc2gB
Joe Biden tweeted: The next president will have to salvage our reputation, rebuild confidence in our leadership, and mobilize our country and our allies to rapidly meet new challenges — like future pandemics.
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: We need a leader who will be ready on day one. https://t.co/oizwBqv4Wd
Joe Biden tweeted: Thank you, Arizona! https://t.co/X8k3ftTFWf
Joe Biden tweeted: Thank you to everyone in Arizona, Florida, and Illinois who supported our campaign. From day one, our goal has been to unify our party and our nation — and tonight, we are one step closer to achieving that goal. Let’s do this, together. https://t.co/tcLufz2SBV
Joe Biden tweeted: I'm about to address tonight's election results from Delaware. Tune in to watch live: https://t.co/zNUoV08KVa

Joe Biden tweeted: Thank you, Florida! https://t.co/i0x0LE5xhs

Joe Biden tweeted: Unity over division
Joe Biden tweeted: Truth over lies
Joe Biden tweeted: Science over fiction
Joe Biden tweeted: Elections are happening today in Arizona, Florida, and Illinois. I encourage folks to vote by mail or curbside vote if you can. If you vote in person, please wash your hands, don’t touch your face, and stay 6’ from others in line. Learn more: https://t.co/yzZZp4uKFk
Joe Biden tweeted: My mom always said, Being Irish is about faith, family, and courage.
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: Today, we celebrate the strong role Irish-Americans have played in our communities, the strength of the U.S.-Ireland relationship, and the ongoing values shared by our two nations. Happy St. Patrick's Day! https://t.co/iUwvpb4Zk8
Joe Biden tweeted: Michigan’s response has far outpaced the federal government’s in this crisis. Gov. Whitmer is leading decisively, while you are live-tweeting her appearances on cable news.
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: We need a president who will do their job and lead this country. https://t.co/WaZhxOdy6x
Joe Biden tweeted: Thank you, Washington! https://t.co/j4tXRZ4znk

Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: A Biden administration will reflect the country we are proud to work for. https://t.co/1rFvE94YIg
Joe Biden tweeted: We are in a battle for the soul of this nation. Donald Trump threatens everything we stand for, he has:
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: - Fanned the flames of hate
Joe Biden tweeted: - Embraced white supremacists
Joe Biden tweeted: - Separated families at the border
Joe Biden tweeted: - Threatened our democracy
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: We have to get him out of the White House.

Joe Biden tweeted: Thank you to our health care providers, first responders, grocery and other retail workers, and so many others that are keeping us safe and prepared. This coronavirus pandemic makes it clear that all workers deserve paid sick live, workplace protections and unemployment benefits.

Joe Biden tweeted: I know times are tough — but we’re going to get through this.

Joe Biden tweeted: Bernie Sanders voted against comprehensive immigration reform — and then went on TV with Lou Dobbs to brag about it.
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: Immigrants don't take our jobs. They create jobs. And we need a President who believes that to his or her core. #DemDebate https://t.co/lHePLtlTpo
Joe Biden tweeted: My running mate will be a woman. #DemDebate
Joe Biden tweeted: If Senator @BernieSanders is the nominee, I will throw my full weight behind his campaign and do everything I can to get him elected. If I am the nominee, I hope he will do the same. Nothing can keep us from being united in the fight to defeat Trump. #DemDebate

Joe Biden tweeted: Equal pay for equal work is common sense — and long overdue. That's why the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act was the first law that the Obama-Biden Administration signed 11 years ago today. We have to continue the fight until we close the gender pay gap once and for all.
Joe Biden tweeted: We need a president who respects religious freedom. https://t.co/5PrjnXCig5

Joe Biden tweeted: A peace plan requires two sides to come together. This is a political stunt that could spark unilateral moves to annex territory and set back peace even more.

Iran has restarted its nuclear program and become more provocative. I’ll return to smart, disciplined diplomacy to address the threats we face.

That's why I strongly support the Transit Worker and Pedestrian Protection Act to protect our workers from harm while doing their job. https://t.co/4nbHsjtKRr
Joe Biden tweeted: Donald Trump has no strategy when it comes to Iran. No endgame. The only way out of his self-made crisis is through diplomacy — clear-eyed, hard-nosed diplomacy grounded in strategy, that's not about one-off decisions or one-upmanship. https://t.co/yfb8OE98Xu

Joe Biden tweeted: - Build a more inclusive middle class
Joe Biden tweeted: - Build on Obamacare
Joe Biden tweeted: - Ensure our government works for everyone — not just the powerful
Joe Biden tweeted: Trump’s reckless policies have needlessly endangered our interests in the Middle East. But none of us should be under any illusions about the Iranian regime, and the Iranian people — like all people everywhere — have the right to peaceful protest. The world should support them.

Joe Biden tweeted: Facebook continues to put their profits over the truth — allowing politicians like Donald Trump to spend an unthinkable amount of money on paid disinformation. Our democracy is worse off for their failure to confront this. https://t.co/sKaAjHsKc7
Joe Biden tweeted: We are so much better than who Donald Trump thinks we are. We don’t have to give in to his dark, petty, angry vision of America. We can choose to be the more perfect union we have always aspired to be — and restore the soul of this nation. https://t.co/nkD23GxirG
Joe Biden tweeted: Instead of using his statement today to lay out a coherent strategy on Iran, Donald Trump used it to mislead the country on the Obama-Biden record. He's been President for three years. It's time he stops blaming President Obama for his failures.
Joe Biden tweeted: I'm thankful no one was hurt in last night's attack. But we're only in this mess because Donald Trump pulled out of the Iran Deal (which even his advisors said was working), turned his back on our allies, and had no strategy for what comes next.
Joe Biden tweeted: Gabby is one of the strongest people I know. The resilience she has shown is remarkable. I'm inspired by her courage in turning tragedy into purpose and grateful for her relentless determination to make our country a safer place for all. https://t.co/PHlQy6cxYF
Joe Biden tweeted: 3,820 days — that's how long it's been since the federal minimum wage was last raised. It’s unacceptable. Raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour nationwide should be just our starting point for ensuring workers receive the pay they deserve. https://t.co/pL3qZXsCJu
Joe Biden tweeted: Pope Francis is absolutely right. As a nation, we have a moral obligation to ensure everyone has access to the care they need. Health care is a right for all — not a privilege for the few. https://t.co/c84y4GAMCq
Joe Biden tweeted: We have to rebuild the middle class. But this time, we have to make sure that people historically left out of the middle class — whether due to race, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or religion — have the chance to be included in our success. https://t.co/YTwf2WYOYd

Joe Biden tweeted: I stand with the people of Puerto Rico, our fellow citizens, in this moment of need.

Joe Biden tweeted: On Día de los Reyes, as Christmas comes to a close, we are reminded of the call of the three kings: to give of ourselves without expectation, seek peace no matter how long the journey, and know that a bright future is within reach. Jill and I wish a Happy Three Kings’ Day to all!
Joe Biden tweeted: Let's be clear: Donald Trump does not have the authority to take us into war with Iran without Congressional approval. A president should never take this nation to war without the informed consent of the American people.

Jill traveled to Matamoros to shed light on how these policies hurt asylum seekers. https://t.co/2Bwwl2pEzq

Joe Biden tweeted: We can defeat him, but only with your help. Chip in what you can before our midnight deadline: https://t.co/e9CcZTIZ9s

Joe Biden tweeted: The subpoenas should go to witnesses with testimony to offer to Trump’s shaking down the Ukraine government — they should go to the White House.
Joe Biden tweeted: But I am just not going to pretend that there is any legal basis for Republican subpoenas for my testimony in the impeachment trial. That is the point I was making yesterday and I reiterate: this impeachment is about Trump’s conduct, not mine.
Joe Biden tweeted: I want to clarify something I said yesterday. In my 40 years in public life, I have always complied with a lawful order and in my eight years as VP, my office — unlike Donald Trump and Mike Pence — cooperated with legitimate congressional oversight requests.

Joe Biden tweeted: Let's go.
Joe Biden tweeted: From the Voting Rights Act renewal, to the ban on assault weapons, to the Violence Against Women Act, to Obamacare, to the Recovery Act that kept us from sliding into a Depression, I’ve delivered progress for you.
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: I know what it takes to get it done.
Joe Biden tweeted: Fixing what's broken in this country will take vision—and yes, it will take plans. But that’s not enough.
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: It also takes the proven ability to get it done. And there is no one on tonight's stage who has a stronger record of passing important, consequential legislation than I do.
Joe Biden tweeted: This election is about you. Your children. Your family. And you can’t wait for a president fighting for you when it comes to health care, or jobs, or education, or guns, or climate. The world can’t wait for America to once again lead a stable, peaceful international order.
Joe Biden tweeted: For days, pundits have let Donald Trump define the conversation around tonight's #DemDebate.
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: Well, Trump doesn't get to pick the Democratic nominee. And I’m not going to be distracted by all his lies, smears, distortions, and name-calling. He’s picked a fight with the wrong guy.
Joe Biden tweeted: Philadelphia's office cleaners work hard every day to keep the city's buildings clean. They deserve the dignity that comes with a living wage, access to health care, and a secure retirement. I stand with @32BJSEIU cleaners in their fight for a fair contract. #BuildingJustice
Joe Biden tweeted: Overturning Citizens United isn’t enough. Ridding our politics of big money and corporate special interests demands more. We must go further.
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: I will introduce a constitutional amendment to get all private dollars out of our federal elections.

Joe Biden tweeted: Our Constitution begins with three simple words, “We the People” — not “We the Donors.” But for too long, corporations and special interests have corrupted our political process and rigged it in their favor.
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: Today, I’m releasing my plan to change that: https://t.co/iGrbvPmRlF

Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: A president should unite us around our shared goals and lift us up, not stoke the flames of hatred and tear us down. https://t.co/WpWikGYt4b
Joe Biden tweeted: I was proud to work with Matthew’s parents, Judy and Dennis, to extend our hate crimes law to cover sexual orientation and gender identity. But there’s still more work to be done — we can’t rest until every single American can live open and proud without fear.
Joe Biden tweeted: 21 years ago, Matthew Shepard passed away after a brutal anti-gay hate crime — an attack that shook the conscience of our nation. As we honor his memory, we must remember that members of the LGBTQ community — especially trans women of color — are still targeted with violence.
Joe Biden tweeted: President Trump believes he can and will get away with anything he does. We all laughed when he said he could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot someone and get away with it.
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: Now, he is shooting holes in our Constitution. We cannot let him get away with it.
Joe Biden tweeted: We believe Americans should decide American elections. But Trump will do anything to get re-elected, including violating the most basic norms of our democracy. It's dangerous.

Joe Biden tweeted: To LGBTQ people suffering persecution anywhere: the American people are on your side. And as president, I will ensure the U.S. leads the world to defend human rights for all.
Joe Biden tweeted: LGBTQ rights are human rights. Uganda's proposed new law is inhumane. Using religion or culture to license discrimination is never justifiable. Period. https://t.co/m54xkTraqm
Joe Biden tweeted: Using religion or culture to discriminate against or demonize LGBTQ individuals is never justified—not anywhere in the world.
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: I will send a clear message from the top of our government: prejudice is prejudice, inhumanity is inhumanity, and the U.S. will not stand for it. https://t.co/HUMcFVSSfA
Joe Biden tweeted: I spent my night at the HRC forum talking about the fundamental respect every human being deserves. You spent yours showing how little respect for anyone else you have. America is so much stronger than your weakness, @realDonaldTrump.
Joe Biden tweeted: Honored to be asked a question at tonight's #EqualityTownHall by my friend Judy Shepard. It was a privilege to work with her to secure the passage of legislation that extended our hate crimes laws to crimes based on sexual orientation and gender identity.
Joe Biden tweeted: We have to make sure that no hospital or health care provider can discriminate against someone simply because of who they are or whom they love. #EqualityTownHall https://t.co/bVgmfgSA06

Joe Biden tweeted: Looking forward to joining @AndersonCooper at tonight’s #EqualityTownHall to discuss the work that remains in the fight for LGBTQ rights. Tune in to CNN at 8PM ET to watch live.
Joe Biden tweeted: For all the hard-won progress we've made in the fight for LGBTQ equality, we're not done — not nearly.
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: We must stand up to President Trump's dangerous attacks on the rights of the LGBTQ community and continue to fight for full equality. https://t.co/Wtxpczcawj
Joe Biden tweeted: Americans should decide American elections. Period. https://t.co/oc5HavIiuf
Joe Biden tweeted: I sat down with @MaraKeisling of the @NCTEActionFund to discuss the progress we’ve made on LGBTQ rights and the work that remains. Transgender equality is the civil rights issue of our time—I won’t stop fighting until everyone is treated with the dignity and respect they deserve. https://t.co/zaLAdKWBrV
Joe Biden tweeted: President Trump picked a fight with the wrong guy. https://t.co/5s7izCLSzt
Joe Biden tweeted: Trump made this decision on a whim, after a phone call with Turkish President Erdogan. There was no process. No consultation with our military, our diplomats, or our allies. Trump got rolled, plain and simple, because he has no idea what he's doing.
Joe Biden tweeted: But that's not all — he betrayed our brave troops, who sacrificed alongside them. He betrayed our word as a nation — raising doubts among our allies around the world about America's security commitments.
Joe Biden tweeted: Donald Trump sold out the Syrian Democratic Forces — the courageous Kurds and Arabs who fought with us to smash ISIS's caliphate — and he betrayed a key local ally in the fight against terrorism. https://t.co/VWJDpISjy2
Joe Biden tweeted: In full view of the American people, Donald Trump has violated his oath of office and betrayed this nation. He must be impeached. https://t.co/ivRAqnHHZb
Joe Biden tweeted: President Trump has decided that we don't have the power or the political will to hold him accountable. He's not just testing us — he's laughing at us.
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: We must prove him wrong. He must be impeached. https://t.co/4ahsVPiqxX
Joe Biden tweeted: Like every bully, President Trump is lashing out because he’s afraid. He’s afraid of how badly I will beat him next November.

Joe Biden tweeted: To preserve our Constitution, our democracy, and our basic integrity — Donald Trump should be impeached. https://t.co/fa14AGZdW9
Joe Biden tweeted: Two days ago, Trump impulsively gave Turkey a green light to invade Syria, blindsiding our military. Today, we see the consequences—Turkish forces attacking the fighters that helped us take on ISIS. It’s a betrayal, takes pressure off the terrorist threat, &amp; leaves us less safe.
Joe Biden tweeted: Every day Donald Trump is in the White House, he poses a grave threat to our democracy. We must make him a one-term president.

Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: Wondering how the plan will benefit you? Take the quiz: https://t.co/ba2juUMDUk https://t.co/eBrukAxvzw
Joe Biden tweeted: Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority-Serving Institutions play a vital role in our communities. A Biden administration will invest $70 billion in these institutions to improve affordability, build high tech labs and facilities, and support student success.
Joe Biden tweeted: A Biden administration will take concrete action to address the student debt crisis in our country. We will expand access to Pell Grants, more than halve income-based payments on undergraduate federal student loans, and make student loan forgiveness work for public servants.
Joe Biden tweeted: .@DrBiden calls community colleges America’s best kept secret — she's right. A Biden administration will invest in these institutions, providing every American with two years of community college or other high-quality training programs without debt.
Joe Biden tweeted: A good education should be a reliable pathway to the middle class. But for too many, earning a credential or degree after high school comes with a mountain of debt or is out of reach altogether.
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: Today, I’m releasing my plan to change that: https://t.co/lU9sfUkPUG

Joe Biden tweeted: As president, I will make passing the Equality Act a top legislative priority. A Biden administration won’t rest until we truly achieve full equality, and everyone is treated with dignity and respect under the law.
Joe Biden tweeted: A president should use the full might of the executive branch to secure justice, dignity, and safety for all. Instead, President Trump does the opposite — callously exerting his power over the most vulnerable.
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: We must send a clear message: We will not stand for this.
Joe Biden tweeted: This week, the Trump Administration is set to argue before the Supreme Court that it’s legal to discriminate against someone simply because of who they are or whom they love. It’s a dangerous attack on the civil rights of LGBTQ Americans and everything we stand for.
Joe Biden tweeted: We cannot, and will not, stand for President Trump’s corruption. We will beat him like a drum.
Joe Biden tweeted: If we stand together we can, and will, end our gun violence epidemic. Read my full plan to address this public health epidemic at https://t.co/AbTUKdGwcV.

Joe Biden tweeted: And to Trump and those who facilitate his abuses of power, and all the special interests funding his attacks against me: Please know that I’m not going anywhere. You won’t destroy me, and you won’t destroy my family. And come November 2020, I intend to beat you like a drum.
Joe Biden tweeted: While the House does its job on impeachment, I’m going to stay focused on what matters: improving the lives of Americans and fighting to ensure that the United States is once again the leader of the free world.
Joe Biden tweeted: It’s the same cynical playbook he returns to again and again. But this time it won’t work, because the American people know me—and they know him. I will put the integrity of my whole career in public service to this nation up against Trump’s lack of integrity any day of the week.
Joe Biden tweeted: Our first president, George Washington, famously could not tell a lie. Trump seemingly cannot tell the truth — about anything. He slanders anyone he sees as a threat. It's why is he is frantically pushing flat-out lies, debunked conspiracy theories and smears against me.
Joe Biden tweeted: Every day, more evidence is uncovered revealing that Trump is abusing the power of the presidency and is wholly unfit to be president. He is using the highest office in the land to advance his personal, political interests instead of the national interest.
Joe Biden tweeted: https://t.co/NNpDITpwBV

Joe Biden tweeted: Esta no es solo una campaña para vencer a Donald Trump - es un movimiento basado en los valores que definen nuestra nación: la honestidad, la decencia, y el tratar a todos con dignidad y respeto, mientras le damos la espalda al odio. Eso es lo que somos como estadounidenses.
Joe Biden tweeted: This can’t just be a campaign to beat Donald Trump. This has to be a movement grounded in the values and ideals that define our nation best: honesty, decency, treating everyone with dignity and respect, and giving hate no safe harbor.

Joe Biden tweeted: Como tantos otros han dicho, la crueldad es su meta. Es su única meta, y es lo único que tienen para postularse: el miedo, la ira, la división y la crueldad. Debemos restaurar el alma de nuestra nación.
Joe Biden tweeted: No hay justificación para traumatizar aún más a los niños enfermos en sus momentos más vulnerables. Como todo abusón, Trump está acosando a los más débiles, pero atacar a niños con cáncer y fibrosis quística es intolerable.
Joe Biden tweeted: No sabemos ya qué decir para condenar la inhumanidad de esta administración que arranca niños de los brazos de sus padres y acosa a las familias en sus vecindarios. Ahora deportará a niños que están recibiendo tratamientos de vida o muerte por afecciones graves.

Joe Biden tweeted: There is no national security justification for further traumatizing sick kids at their most vulnerable. Like all bullies, Trump is purposefully targeting the little guys—but I would have thought even he would understand that kids with cancer and cystic fibrosis were off-limits.
Joe Biden tweeted: We are running out of words to condemn the inhumanity of this administration. An administration that pulls children from the arms of their parents and stalks families in their neighborhoods will now deport children who are in life-saving treatment for dire conditions like cancer.
Joe Biden tweeted: Our military families sacrifice everything in service to our nation. And today, the Trump Administration revoked automatic citizenship for some of their children.

Joe Biden tweeted: When it comes to meeting the existential crisis of our time, Trump has walked away from the table — literally. If we give Trump four more years, the planet may never recover from his utter disregard for the climate crisis and scientific fact.
Joe Biden tweeted: The distance Trump has put between the U.S. and the rest of the world on the issues that matter most to Americans couldn't be more clear. There is no more telling metaphor for this administration's abdication of American leadership than the empty chair at the G-7 climate meeting.
Joe Biden tweeted: After three days, we have even more evidence of how President Trump's disastrous foreign policy has left the U.S. isolated. Rather than looking to America for vision, our closest democratic allies sought to manage and mitigate the damage Trump might do at this year's G-7.

Joe Biden tweeted: 30 years ago, 2 million people joined hands to form the Baltic Way—a chain of human determination that reached across Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania in defiance of Soviet oppression. It was—and remains—a powerful demonstration of the irrepressible desire for freedom.
Joe Biden tweeted: Today, demonstrators in Hong Kong, inspired by the iconic Baltic Way protest, formed a human chain to demand China live up to its promises to the people of Hong Kong. They once more showed the world the common yearning for liberty that unites us all.

Joe Biden tweeted: At moments when we have been tested most, American presidents have stepped up.
Joe Biden tweeted:

Joe Biden tweeted: We are almost 330 million Americans who have to do what our president can’t. Stand together. Stand against hate. Stand up for what—at our best—this nation believes.
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: If we stand together, we will win the battle for the soul of this nation.
Joe Biden tweeted: So it’s up to us. We’re living through a rare moment in this nation’s history. Where our president isn’t up to the moment. Where our president lacks the moral authority to lead. Where our president has more in common with George Wallace than George Washington.
Joe Biden tweeted: Trump offers no moral leadership, no interest in unifying the nation, and no evidence the presidency has awakened his conscience in the least.
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: Instead, we have a president with a toxic tongue who has unapologetically embraced a political strategy of hate, racism, and division.
Joe Biden tweeted: At moments when we have been tested most, American presidents have stepped up. They led, opposed hate, and chose to fight for the best of the American character.
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: We don’t have that today. Our president has aligned himself with the darkest forces in this nation.
Joe Biden tweeted: The honest truth is both elements are part of the American character. At our best, the American ideal wins out. But it’s never a rout. It’s always a fight. And the battle is never finished.
Joe Biden tweeted: I wish I could say this hate began with Trump and will end with him. It didn’t &amp; it won’t.
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: The battle for the soul of this nation has been a constant push-and-pull between the American ideal that we are all created equal &amp; the harsh reality that racism has long torn us apart.
Joe Biden tweeted: In both clear language and in code, this president has fanned the flames of white supremacy in this nation.
Joe Biden tweeted: How far is it from the white supremacists and Neo-Nazis in Charlottesville – Trump’s “very fine people” – chanting “You will not replace us” to the shooter at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh saying Jews “were committing genocide to his people.”
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: Not far at all.
Joe Biden tweeted: How far is it from Trump’s saying this “is an invasion” to the shooter in El Paso declaring “this attack is a response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas”?
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: Not far at all.
Joe Biden tweeted: I said at the time that we were in a battle for the soul of this nation. I said it again when I announced. It’s why I’m running for president.
Joe Biden tweeted: When he said after Charlottesville that there were “very fine people on both sides” he gave license and safe harbor for hate to white supremacists, Neo-Nazis, and the KKK.
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: Those words stunned the nation and shocked the world.
Joe Biden tweeted: The words of a president matter. They can move markets. They can send our brave men and women to war. They can bring peace.

Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: As president, I will restore the VRA, stand up to attacks on the right to vote, &amp; renew our efforts to ensure every American’s voice is equal.
Joe Biden tweeted: The fight for civil rights is one of the things that got me engaged in politics. And when I was ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, we successfully extended the #VotingRightsAct for 25 years.

Joe Biden tweeted: https://t.co/0eUEzzUCQJ
Joe Biden tweeted: Let's be very clear. You use the office of the presidency to encourage and embolden white supremacy. You use words like infestation and invasion to talk about human beings. We won't truly speak with one voice against hatred until your voice is no longer in the White House. https://t.co/CW3wxxTm2E
Joe Biden tweeted: Mr. President, immigration isn’t the problem. White nationalism is the problem. America’s inaction on gun safety legislation is the problem.

Joe Biden tweeted: We can’t fix a problem if we refuse to name it: white nationalism. An ideology emboldened by a president who stokes the flames of hatred and coddles white supremacists with messages of support.
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: We must do what Trump won't: condemn this evil and eradicate it from our society.
Joe Biden tweeted: We are in a battle for the soul of this nation. And in this moment, we all have a responsibility to declare with conviction that hatred and bigotry and white supremacy have no place in America. We will give hate no safe harbor.
Joe Biden tweeted: We have to address what’s happening in America. We continue to bear witness to acts of terror carried out with a common thread: hatred of “the other.” We saw it in Charlottesville two years ago, at synagogues in Pittsburgh and Poway, and now in El Paso.
Joe Biden tweeted: Assault weapons and high-capacity magazines don’t belong on our streets. We must stand up to the @NRA and gun manufacturers—they don’t own this country. We the people own this country.
Joe Biden tweeted: At least 29 lives stolen, families broken, communities shattered in El Paso and Dayton within 13 hours. Dozens more wounded. Between those two mass shootings, dozens more were killed and injured by gun violence that didn't make national headlines.
Joe Biden tweeted: Heartbroken to hear the news from El Paso. Our thoughts are with those impacted by yet another senseless act of gun violence in America.
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: How many lives must be cut short? How many communities must be torn apart? It’s past time we take action and end our gun violence epidemic.
Joe Biden tweeted: It’s clear that climate change is already here. Today. And we need to take urgent action to address it.

Joe Biden tweeted: Donald Trump is echoing his authoritarian heroes, again—this time using China's anti-democracy talking points to describe the peaceful protests in Hong Kong as riots. It's shameful.
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: When people suffering under oppression look to the U.S. for hope, Trump has nothing to offer.
Joe Biden tweeted: Yet more proof that Trump doesn’t care about the farmers, workers, and consumers that are being crushed by his irresponsible tariff war with China. It’s easy to act tough when someone else is feeling the pain.
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: I will reverse his senseless policies.
Joe Biden tweeted: https://t.co/8XrVcUjUB5

Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: No other nation has the capacity. No other nation is built on that idea—that promise. And it’s in our self-interest.
Joe Biden tweeted: No army on earth can match how the electric idea of liberty passes freely from person to person, jumps borders, transcends languages and cultures—how it can supercharge communities of ordinary citizens into activists and organizers and change agents.
Joe Biden tweeted: We know that economic security is national security. But there are a lot of communities across this country that are hurting—because we’ve neglected the basics.

Joe Biden tweeted: Here’s what I commit to you: I will name a Secretary of Education who is an educator. https://t.co/FC37ZMAKAr
Joe Biden tweeted: The abuse of a child is one of the most heinous, despicable abuses of power imaginable. It is inexcusably poor judgment for a US Attorney to seek leniency for someone guilty of it. Secretary Acosta should provide his resignation immediately.
Joe Biden tweeted: We can’t tear down the ACA. We should protect and build on it. In America, health care should be a right—not a privilege.
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: As president, I’ll do everything in my power to stand up to the attacks on the ACA and expand coverage to ensure everyone has access to the care they need.
Joe Biden tweeted: The Affordable Care Act was and is a big deal. It covered 20 million more people, protects more than 100 million people with pre-existing conditions, and expanded Medicaid — giving millions of Americans the peace of mind that comes with health insurance.
Joe Biden tweeted: Today, the Affordable Care Act is back in the courts — putting the health care of millions of Americans at risk. It’s clear some will stop at nothing to sabotage Obamacare and roll back the progress we’ve made. https://t.co/7SEAx4HZrd

Joe Biden tweeted: We just wrapped up a great event in Marshalltown, Iowa. Thank you to everyone who came out to join us on this #FourthOfJuly! https://t.co/z6mHBLcPWQ
Joe Biden tweeted: Every year on the #FourthOfJuly, presidents, elected leaders, and everyday Americans come together at parades, bbqs, and baseball games to celebrate humankind’s highest ideal — liberty. That’s what we’re celebrating today in Iowa.
Joe Biden tweeted: Will he offer a robust defense of the democratic values that have always been our strength in times of crisis? We all know the answer to that.
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: Donald Trump is incapable of celebrating what makes America great because he doesn’t get it.
Joe Biden tweeted: What will Donald Trump say this evening when he speaks to the nation at an event designed more to stroke his ego than celebrate American ideals? Will he speak to the example America must set to inspire the world?
Joe Biden tweeted: As I celebrate today with friends &amp; family, I am reflecting on the promise those rebels envisioned 243 years ago. America hasn’t lived up to that promise for most people—but we’ve never stopped trying. We must continue in our pursuit until we achieve equality &amp; liberty for all.
Joe Biden tweeted: We have to be against his policies that are further entrenching economic inequality in this nation. That are rigging the system against the middle class.
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: That too is an attack on our democracy, on our liberty.
Joe Biden tweeted: It’s not enough to be against the way Donald Trump conducts himself — we have to be against the way he assaults the dignity of women, people of color, and immigrants.
Joe Biden tweeted: We have to take on the inequalities in our system that are causing too many today—in America and around the world—to question their faith in the ability of democracy to deliver for them.
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: It’s not enough to be for political equality. We have to be for economic fairness as well.
Joe Biden tweeted: My liberty, depends on yours. Our liberty as a nation rests on our ability to ensure equal access and equal opportunity — not just for our own children, but all our children.
Joe Biden tweeted: But we must also remember, as JFK put it, that ours is “not the individual liberty of one but the indivisible liberty of all.” Donald Trump doesn’t get that.
Joe Biden tweeted: America is the heart of the Free World, and we must defend it. That is how the #FourthOfJuly is best honored — by remembering that our Declaration is first and foremost a call to arms, in defense of liberty.
Joe Biden tweeted: And ever since then, presidents and patriots have gathered together on the Fourth to reflect on the greater meaning of our American experiment.
Joe Biden tweeted: 243 years ago, a group of rebels in Philadelphia pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor to a revolutionary idea, to the self-evident truth that all men — and women — are created equal.
Joe Biden tweeted: It’s fitting that we’re celebrating Independence Day in Independence, Iowa. Thank you to everyone who said hello at this morning’s #FourthOfJuly parade — it was great to see so many supporters! https://t.co/tEOXY8wLAn
Joe Biden tweeted: America is an idea — stronger than any army, more powerful than any dictator. It gives hope to the most desperate people on Earth. Instills in us the belief that no matter where you start in life, there's nothing you can't achieve.
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: That's worth celebrating. Happy #FourthofJuly
Joe Biden tweeted: Thank you to everyone who came out to our event in Waterloo! RSVP to join us tomorrow in Independence and Marshalltown: https://t.co/PyvclvDFPY https://t.co/oEwfwHez3A
Joe Biden tweeted: DREAMers—young people who came to the U.S. as children—are Americans. They don’t deserve to sit in limbo as the Supreme Court decides whether President Trump can end the Obama-Biden DACA policy. Congress should act now to give them a path to citizenship. https://t.co/4teULJvgki

Joe Biden tweeted: But as we mark the 55th anniversary, we must recognize that the work is not done. Too many Americans still face the sting of systemic racism and discrimination. We must double down on our efforts to root out these evils and ensure America lives up to its promise for all.
Joe Biden tweeted: It also laid the groundwork for other milestones and freedoms to follow — from the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Because when justice rings out for one group, it rings for all groups in America. We’re all made better.
Joe Biden tweeted: The Civil Rights Act for the first time made real the possibility of equal access to employment. It outlawed discrimination in public facilities, and it gave the Attorney General of the United States of America the power to enforce the law to combat discrimination.
Joe Biden tweeted: It took the courage and determination of generations of African Americans who refused to wither in the face of racism and intolerance. Their resolve fundamentally changed the character of our nation for the better.
Joe Biden tweeted: Today marks 55 years since the signing of the Civil Rights Act — the landmark piece of legislation that brought our nation closer to fulfilling the promise that was made two centuries earlier in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. A promise of equality, equity, and fairness for all.
Joe Biden tweeted: The Department of Commerce just announced the 2020 Census will not have President Trump’s citizenship question. This is not only a victory for immigrants and Latinos, but for all Americans. Everyone deserves to be counted and have their voices heard without fear.
Joe Biden tweeted: Luis Alvarez was an American hero—@DrBiden and I are sending our thoughts and prayers to his family.

Joe Biden tweeted: One in five students experience mental health problems, but too often they don’t get the care they need. In a Biden administration, we will double the number of mental health professionals in schools to give our kids the support they deserve. https://t.co/tGh2Rgd9MX
Joe Biden tweeted: Income inequality is on the rise — made worse by the Trump tax cut that was a giant giveaway to the super-wealthy. We’ve got to rebuild the backbone of this country — the middle class.
Joe Biden tweeted:  
Joe Biden tweeted: That starts by rewarding work, not just wealth.
Joe Biden tweeted: Iran has now restarted its nuclear program and has become more, rather than less, aggressive. Trump's Iran policy has alienated us from our allies and taken us to the brink of another war in the Middle East.
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: Everything this president does is backwards.
Joe Biden tweeted: Iran needs to get back into compliance with its nuclear commitments, but Trump appears to have no plan for ensuring that result either. His policy of maximum pressure has produced worse than minimum results.
Joe Biden tweeted: And even as Trump has rushed to legitimize a dictator in North Korea with dozens of nuclear weapons, he trashed the Iran nuclear deal — a deal that was working to keep Iran far away from a single nuclear bomb.
Joe Biden tweeted: Not one missile or nuclear weapon has been destroyed, not one inspector is on the ground. If anything, the situation has gotten worse. North Korea has continued to churn out fissile material and is no longer an isolated pariah on the world stage.
Joe Biden tweeted: In this case, all Trump achieved was a mere promise to restart working-level negotiations — negotiations that should have never ended.
Joe Biden tweeted: Yet again, Donald Trump has demonstrated that he is more concerned with a photo op for himself than getting results for the American people. He has repeatedly elevated Kim Jong Un — a murderous tyrant — on the international stage in exchange for almost nothing.
Joe Biden tweeted: President Trump’s failure to lead on the climate crisis is inexcusable — it endangers the future of our country and planet.
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: As president, I’ll rejoin the #ParisAgreement and rally the world to push our progress further and faster.

Joe Biden tweeted: Yesterday’s verdict doesn’t take away the pain or the loss of Heather Heyer on that day in Charlottesville, but is hopefully a step toward healing and a sense of justice. https://t.co/CZLYSTUtMC
Joe Biden tweeted: The same forces of hatred rooted in 'birtherism' that questioned @BarackObama's American citizenship, and even his racial identity, are now being used against Senator @KamalaHarris. It’s disgusting and we have to call it out when we see it. Racism has no place in America.
Joe Biden tweeted: We're in a battle for the soul of this nation. We can end the politics of division that’s pulling this country apart and move forward again ⁠— but it’s going to take everyone rolling up their sleeves and doing their part.
Joe Biden tweeted:

Joe Biden tweeted: I’m about to take the debate stage. The large, diverse Democratic field is evidence of our party's strength. And above all, we all agree that we need to make Donald Trump a one-term president. #DemDebate
Joe Biden tweeted: We have to choose hope over fear, truth over lies, and unity over division. I hope you’ll tune in tonight as we discuss these important issues and more. If you like what you hear, I ask you to join us by signing up at https://t.co/FiM7U862fT. Let’s get to work.
Joe Biden tweeted: We can do all this and more – all that stands in the way is a broken political system. We have to unite this country. And we can do it without compromising our principles. That’s the only way we’re going to be able to harness the incredible potential of the American people.
Joe Biden tweeted: Climate change is an existential threat. We have to take urgent, drastic action now to address the climate emergency. On day one, I’ll take the bold action necessary to tackle this crisis head-on and rally the world to raise our ambitions. https://t.co/Tg2yqpL8DO
Joe Biden tweeted: We have to transform education. We’ll provide universal Pre-K, triple Title I funding, raise teacher pay, double the number of mental health professionals in our schools, and eliminate disparities between rich and poor schools. https://t.co/6oqEuc5N8Q
Joe Biden tweeted: Under my plan, everyone will have the option to buy into a public health plan like Medicare. And we’ll guarantee that the poor – who otherwise would be covered by the Medicaid expansion – are automatically covered, free of charge.
Joe Biden tweeted: We need to defend and build on the Affordable Care Act. I was proud every day to serve alongside President Obama as Vice President – but never more so than the day the Affordable Care Act passed. Now we have to finish the job.
Joe Biden tweeted: It’s time to reward work, not just wealth. On day one, I’ll move to: eliminate the Trump tax cut for the super-wealthy, cut the unjustified loopholes in our tax code, and use that money to invest in America’s future.
Joe Biden tweeted: The poor are getting poorer and the bottom is falling out of the middle class. Income inequality is on the rise — made worse by the Trump tax cut that was a giant give-away to the super-wealthy.
Joe Biden tweeted: We have to rebuild the backbone of this nation – the middle class. And this time make sure everyone comes along, regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, or disability.
Joe Biden tweeted: Every day we are being reminded what this election is about. Who we are. What we stand for. What we believe. I am running to offer our country a different path – not back to a past that never was, but to a future that fulfills our true potential as a country.
Joe Biden tweeted: We know in our bones this election is different. We have a president who promotes hate and division. Encourages white supremacists. Embraces dictators. And damages our alliances internationally.
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: Our politics traffics in division. And our president is the divider in chief.
Joe Biden tweeted: In an hour, I’ll take the stage for the first Democratic debate to discuss my vision for the country. As I’ve said from day one, I’m running for president for three reasons: to restore the soul of this nation, rebuild its backbone — the middle class, and unify all Americans.
Joe Biden tweeted: From day one, we've refused to take money from any corporate PACs or lobbyists. Today, I’m building on that base by signing @NoFossilMoney’s pledge to reject support from the PACs, lobbyists, or executives of fossil fuel companies.

Joe Biden tweeted: Today’s decision from the court hopefully means there will not be a question on the 2020 Census, but we have much more work to do to ensure all voices are heard in our democracy.
Joe Biden tweeted: Make no mistake, the Trump Administration added a citizenship question to the Census to deliberately cut out the voices of immigrants and communities of color. It’s wrong and goes against our core values as a nation.
Joe Biden tweeted: Today the Supreme Court refused to stop politicians rigging our democracy by writing election rules for their own benefit. It couldn’t have happened without Justices put there by Donald Trump and Republicans — another reason why Democrats must take back the White House in 2020.
Joe Biden tweeted: I was proud to sign @IndivisibleTeam’s pledge. Our large and diverse set of qualified Democratic candidates is evidence of our strength as a party, and I am committed to supporting whomever becomes the nominee. The most important thing is to beat Donald Trump. Period. https://t.co/KiBiOOZpDm
Joe Biden tweeted: All marriages, at their root, are about love. And four years ago, the Supreme Court affirmed that simple proposition in Obergefell v. Hodges. Thank you to the generations of LGBTQ trailblazers who refused to bend before the voices of intolerance. Your courage changed the world.
Joe Biden tweeted: This image is gut-wrenching. The cruelty we're seeing at our border is unconscionable. History will judge how we respond to the Trump Administration’s treatment of immigrant families &amp; children—we can’t be silent. This isn't who we are. This is not America.https://t.co/ZeMBmwUHxU
Joe Biden tweeted: One year ago, the Supreme Court upheld Trump's Muslim ban—one of this administration's most egregious attacks on our core values. Wielding the politics of fear and intolerance by slandering entire religious communities as complicit in terrorism is wrong, and it’s not who we are.
Joe Biden tweeted: DREAMers are Americans, and Congress needs to make it official. The millions of DREAMers and undocumented individuals in the United States can only be brought out of the shadows through fair treatment, not ugly threats.
Joe Biden tweeted: In two days, I’ll take the stage for the first Democratic debate to discuss my vision for the country. If you haven’t yet, RSVP to attend a watch party in your community today: https://t.co/ai8Gixr1tV https://t.co/o5pV6OJN76

Joe Biden tweeted: Add your name to call on Congress to restore the Voting Rights Act and make every American's voice equal, once and for all. #RestoreTheVote https://t.co/CoEvHyLljj
Joe Biden tweeted: Civil rights was one of the things that got me engaged in politics. Six years after Shelby County v. Holder, voting rights are under attack across the country. And that’s one of the reasons I’m running for president today.
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: We must renew our efforts to protect the right to vote. https://t.co/IXrZ8dJWRq
Joe Biden tweeted: .@GabbyGiffords’ dedication to making our communities safer continues to be an inspiration. I join her in urging the Senate to vote on #BackgroundChecksNow. We must take on the @NRA and end the epidemic of gun violence in our country. https://t.co/XqRzkRe2KY

Joe Biden tweeted: Trump sólo está interesado en políticas que atacan la dignidad de la comunidad Latina y asustan a los votantes para que se presenten en las urnas el día de las elecciones, sin interés por abordar los desafíos reales que enfrenta nuestro hemisferio. https://t.co/YEXsBZizKK
Joe Biden tweeted: It’s clear Trump is only interested in using his policies to assault the dignity of the Hispanic community and scare voters to turn out on Election Day, while not addressing the real challenges facing our hemisphere.

Joe Biden tweeted: The Trump Administration is arguing in the 9th Circuit that migrant children held in detention centers without soap, toothbrushes or beds are in conditions that are “safe and sanitary”.
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: It’s an all-out assault on human dignity and our standards as a nation. We must do better.
Joe Biden tweeted: Trump’s erratic, impulsive actions are the last thing we need as Commander-in-Chief. No president should order a military strike without fully understanding the consequences. We don’t need another war in the Middle East, but Trump’s actions toward Iran only make that more likely.
Joe Biden tweeted: Planned Parenthood helps women and individuals get the health care they need — especially preventive services like cancer screenings, mammograms, checkups, and contraception.
Joe Biden tweeted:

Joe Biden tweeted: President Trump continues to deny the scientific evidence in front of his own eyes and attack the progress we’ve made on climate change. It’s unacceptable. 
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: In a Biden Administration, we’ll turbocharge our efforts to achieve a 100% clean energy economy.
Joe Biden tweeted: https://t.co/6WLinHjje2

Joe Biden tweeted: This month marks 50 years since a movement was born on Christopher Street — a movement that has delivered so much acceptance &amp; hope &amp; pride for the LGBTQ community. I stopped by @TheStonewallNYC to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the uprising that changed our world forever. https://t.co/i2ShQVIKjm
Joe Biden tweeted: What we need is presidential leadership that will take strategic action to counter the Iranian threat, restore America's standing in the world, recognize the value of principled diplomacy, and strengthen our nation and our security by working strategically with our allies.
Joe Biden tweeted: Make no mistake: Iran continues to be a bad actor that abuses human rights and supports terrorist activities throughout the region.
Joe Biden tweeted: It’s sadly ironic that the State Department is now calling on Iran to abide by the very deal the Trump Administration abandoned.
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: By walking away from diplomacy, Trump has made military conflict more likely. Another war in the Middle East is the last thing we need.
Joe Biden tweeted: But they’ve only gotten more aggressive. Trump also promised that walking away would somehow lead to a better deal – instead, the predictable has happened: Iran is building back up its nuclear capability.
Joe Biden tweeted: He unilaterally withdrew from the hard-won nuclear agreement that the Obama-Biden Administration negotiated to stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. Trump promised that abandoning the deal and imposing sanctions would stop Iran’s aggression in the region.
Joe Biden tweeted: President Trump's Iran strategy is a self-inflicted disaster. Two of America's vital interests in the Middle East are preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon and securing a stable energy supply through the Strait of Hormuz. Trump is failing on both counts.
Joe Biden tweeted: As we recognize Juneteenth and the progress we’ve made since slavery, we must also double down on our efforts to root out systemic racism. We have to make sure we’re working to move closer to that more perfect union, to the idea of America that has inspired so many generations.
Joe Biden tweeted: America was founded on the ideals of equality, equity, &amp; fairness—but has failed to live up to that promise for all people. In 2019, the unemployment rate for black people is almost twice that of white people. Children born poor are twice as likely to stay poor if they’re black.
Joe Biden tweeted: Trump’s policies appear intentionally designed to aggravate the situation to scare Americans into re-electing him. Cutting off aid to Central America will increase migration to our Southern border, not reduce it.
Joe Biden tweeted: President Trump threatening the mass deportation of immigrants is cruel and un-American. We can fix our broken immigration system and enforce our laws without tossing aside our values. https://t.co/0NE6CitDKM
Joe Biden tweeted: This is truly the most important election of our lifetime. If we want to defeat Donald Trump, it’s going to take everyone stepping up, speaking out, and taking action.
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: Join our team today and let’s get to work: https://t.co/gnaFCACYrW
Joe Biden tweeted: Trump’s response to Charlottesville two years ago was abhorrent, but it’s not just that. It’s happening every day. Separating children from their parents at the border. Attacking women's rights. Rolling back LGBTQ protections. 
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: We’re better than this.
Joe Biden tweeted: Just look at his tax plan.
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: As president, Biden will reverse Trump’s tax cuts for the super wealthy. It’s time we reward work, not just wealth.
Joe Biden tweeted: https://t.co/byDWQAumwg
Joe Biden tweeted: Let’s be clear: President Trump inherited a growing economy from the Obama-Biden administration. And now, he’s in the process of squandering it.
Joe Biden tweeted: Hey there - @TeamJoe here. President Trump dismisses everything he doesn’t want to hear as “FAKE NEWS” -- so as he announces his re-election, we want to make sure you have the real facts on his record:
Joe Biden tweeted: For all the hard-won progress, for as much as we can celebrate how much better things have gotten — this fight is not over.
Joe Biden tweeted:

Joe Biden tweeted: It will also include premium-free access to this public option for people who would otherwise qualify for Medicaid, but have been denied access to it by governors and state legislatures who have refused the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion.
Joe Biden tweeted: Lastly, I discussed how my health care plan will include access to a Medicare-like public option for anyone who wants it.
Joe Biden tweeted: I declared that we have to do everything we can to protect the most sacred, fundamental right we have: the right to vote.
Joe Biden tweeted: I discussed how in a Biden Administration, we’ll support teachers and ensure every kid has access to a quality education. Because in America, no child’s future should be determined by their zip code, parents’ income, race, or disability. https://t.co/d1o4WnDczV
Joe Biden tweeted: I talked about how the greatest sin is the abuse of power — whether economic, or physical, or social. And, it’s our duty to fight back against those who would abuse it.
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: That starts with access to a real living wage — a $15 minimum wage.
Joe Biden tweeted: I was honored to join @UniteThePoor, @RevDrBarber, and @liztheo at today’s #PPCMoralCongress Presidential Forum.
Joe Biden tweeted: Today, I took @EricHolder's @demredistrict pledge to support #FairMaps. For too long, gerrymandering has allowed politicians to pick who they represent. That’s wrong. I’m committed to fair redistricting where elected officials are accountable to those they represent.
Joe Biden tweeted: Four years ago, a white supremacist walked into Mother Emanuel and gunned down nine brave souls, including my friend Clementa Pinckney. It's not enough to remember them. We have to fight for them. We are in a battle for the soul of this nation.
Joe Biden tweeted: 7 years ago, @BarackObama and I offered security to DREAMers, young people brought here as kids who only know America as home. Trump is trying to break our country's promise to them &amp; continues to threaten their status.
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: DREAMers are Americans. It’s time we kept our word to them.
Joe Biden tweeted: Good luck to the @USWNT as they take on Chile! 
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: As we cheer them on in the World Cup, we must support their fight off the field for equal pay. In 2019, it’s past time we close the pay gap and ensure women get paid as much as men. #OneNationOneTeam https://t.co/bJQZm2aQMv
Joe Biden tweeted: As my father believed, there’s no higher calling for a woman or a man than to be a good mother or a good father. Happy Father’s Day to all the dads out there who work every day to help raise their children—and all our children—to be honorable, generous, kind young men and women. https://t.co/6B8hbfOIft
Joe Biden tweeted: This country wasn’t built by Wall Street bankers, CEOs, or hedge fund managers. It was built by the American middle class. It’s time we recognize that.
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: We’ve got to build an economy and a tax code that rewards work, not just wealth.
Joe Biden tweeted: In America, no child’s future should be determined by their zip code, parents’ income, race, or disability. In a Biden Administration, we’ll invest in our students, schools, and educators to ensure every kid gets a fair shot.

Joe Biden tweeted: The extraordinary bravery shown by hundreds of thousands in Hong Kong, marching for the civil liberties &amp; autonomy promised by China is inspiring. And the world is watching. All of us must stand in support of democratic principles and freedom.
Joe Biden tweeted: This is simple. No candidate running for office should help foreign governments undermine our democracy. That includes the sitting President of the United States. Our elections should be decided by the American people — not Vladimir Putin.
Joe Biden tweeted: Donald Trump doesn’t think it matters if candidates accept damaging intel on their opponent from a foreign government. He’s dead wrong.
Joe Biden tweeted:

Joe Biden tweeted: I have nothing against Amazon, but no company pulling in billions of dollars of profits should pay a lower tax rate than firefighters and teachers. We need to reward work, not just wealth. https://t.co/R6xaN3vXGT
Joe Biden tweeted: President Trump is once again welcoming foreign interference in our elections. This isn’t about politics. It is a threat to our national security. An American President should not seek their aid and abet those who seek to undermine democracy.
Joe Biden tweeted: We had a great day in Iowa talking about how we rebuild the backbone of our country — the middle class. Thank you to everyone who came out to join us! https://t.co/49jUzP89F1
Joe Biden tweeted: Today in 1967, the Supreme Court struck down interracial marriage bans in Loving v. Virginia—a decision that inched us closer to our founding ideals of equality, equity, &amp; fairness.
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: The decision reminds us progress doesn’t happen on its own—every generation has to fight for it.
Joe Biden tweeted: Our 9/11 first responders represent the best of our country — selflessly rushing into danger to save others. We owe them so much, and the least we can do is provide the health care and benefits they deserve.

Joe Biden tweeted: Three years later, the horrific attack on Pulse Nightclub still shakes our nation to the core. A night that should have been a celebration of love and life was cut short by unspeakable terror. Today, we remember those we lost — including so many in the LGBTQ community. https://t.co/vdNyZEjlRr

Joe Biden tweeted: We can’t afford four more years of an administration that gambles with the livelihoods of American families. Working families deserve a president who is fighting for them. #TeamJoe
Joe Biden tweeted: Trump doesn’t get the basics. He thinks his tariffs are being paid by China. Any freshman econ student could tell you that the American people are paying his tariffs.
Joe Biden tweeted: 
Joe Biden tweeted: The cashiers at Target see what’s going on – they know more about economics than Trump. #TeamJoe
Joe Biden tweeted: He thinks he’s being tough. Well, it’s easy to be tough when someone else is feeling the pain. How many farmers across Iowa and across this nation are facing the prospect of losing their business, of losing their farm because of Trump’s tariffs? #TeamJoe
Joe Biden tweeted: Tune in here: https://t.co/4rTMVjJzyb

Joe Biden tweeted: I know how to beat the NRA because I’ve done it before - twice. I shepherded through the passage of the Brady background check bill in 1993, and bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines in 1994. As president, I will defeat the NRA again.
Joe Biden tweeted: We can’t let a special interest group dictate the safety of the rest of the country. That’s why defeating the NRA is a key element of our education policy we introduced last week.
Joe Biden tweeted: We will be rolling out policies to reduce gun violence in the coming months, but it’s clear we need to: 
Joe Biden tweeted: - Close the loophole that allows individuals to buy guns online or at gun shows without a background check.
Joe Biden tweeted: - Ban the sale of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.
Joe Biden tweeted: There are actions that Congress can take right now if they were to listen to the majority of the American people who want to see our government take action to stop gun violence.
Joe Biden tweeted: We don't need to convince the American public that common-sense measures to reduce gun violence are a good idea. 2 in 3 people believe that we need stricter gun laws.
Joe Biden tweeted: This is politics at its worst. We should all feel safe to walk the streets of our own cities and towns. Our workers should feel safe at work. Our students should always feel safe at school.
Joe Biden tweeted: We need action. But the NRA and gun manufacturers have such a firm grip on Republicans in Congress that they refuse to consider common-sense gun reforms.
Joe Biden tweeted: Today is #NationalGunViolenceAwarenessDay. Our team, and people across the country, are wearing orange in remembrance of the countless lives that have been cut short by senseless acts of gun violence in America.
Joe Biden tweeted: Women’s rights and health care are under assault in a way that seeks to roll back every step of progress we’ve made over the last 50 years. If I believe health care is a right, as I do, I can no longer support an amendment that makes that right dependent on someone’s zip code.
Joe Biden tweeted: Today, we honor all those who answered duty’s call on June 6, 1944, not only in memorials and remembrances, but in recommitting ourselves to the urgent task of defending those values for which they fought and so many died.
Joe Biden tweeted: Their valor cemented in history their place of honor and it planted the seeds of what would grow to become the greatest military alliance in the history of the world—one that would preserve the peace and extend the hard won gains of democracy for their children and grandchildren.
Joe Biden tweeted: We will never forget what the conviction and mettle of those young patriots achieved—for all of us.
Joe Biden tweeted: With uncommon courage and unfailing honor, Allied forces claimed the first few feet in the drive to turn back an empire born of hatred and prevent it from consuming Europe. They did it not for personal posterity or political gain, but simply because there was no other choice.
Joe Biden tweeted: 75 years ago, far from home, on those bloody beachheads of Normandy, thousands of brave young Americans risked everything to prove that freedom, justice, and democracy would never bend before the forces of fascism and intolerance.

Joe Biden tweeted: China’s continuing oppression of its own people, especially the abuse and internment of more than one million Uyghurs, is one of the worst human rights crises in the world today. It can’t be ignored. Human rights must be at the core—not periphery—of our engagement in the world.
Joe Biden tweeted: Today is the anniversary of China's brutal crackdown in Tiananmen Square. Authorities tried to stop peaceful calls for political change with rifles &amp; tanks. The courage of the Tiananmen generation hasn't been silenced &amp; still inspires the fight for freedom and justice worldwide.

Joe Biden tweeted: Over the last year, six children have tragically died in US custody at the border. It’s unacceptable. It’s not who we are. And silence is complicity.

Joe Biden tweeted: On Saturday, we officially kicked off our campaign in Philadelphia — the city that brought our nation together over 200 years ago.

Joe Biden tweeted: In the 25 years since we passed the Violence Against Women Act, we’ve made great strides in protecting women from abuse. But the latest reauthorization is being held up by the @NRA. It’s outrageous. This shouldn’t be a partisan issue—the Senate should pass the #VAWA immediately.

Joe Biden tweeted: Trump doesn’t understand the struggles working folks go through. He doesn’t understand what it’s like to worry you will lose the roof over your head. He doesn’t understand what it’s like to wonder if you’ll be able to put food on the table.

Joe Biden tweeted: My wife Jill always reminds me that any country that out-educates us will out-compete us. Our teachers must have the resources they need &amp; the wages they deserve so that America will continue to lead the world. Great speech today on this from @rweingarten. https://t.co/aaU10GNjOB
Joe Biden tweeted: I'm on my way up to a rally at #StopandShop in Boston to stand with some of the 31,000 @UFCW union members who are currently fighting against cuts to wages and health care for themselves and their families. Stand with us: https://t.co/D4baO7D5xH
Joe Biden tweeted: For centuries, Notre Dame Cathedral has withstood wars, revolutions, and the test of time. It is a symbol of faith &amp; a testament to history. And even as our hearts break to see it burn today during the holiest week of the year for Catholics, I have faith that it will rise again.
Joe Biden tweeted: This is powerful. I would encourage everyone to read and take to heart Kyle’s message on privilege. https://t.co/Kceif5wFvg

Politics to me has always been about making connections, but I will be more mindful about respecting personal space in the future. That’s my responsibility and I will meet it. https://t.co/Ya2mf5ODts
Joe Biden tweeted: Stoning people to death for homosexuality or adultery is appalling and immoral. Every single person on earth is entitled to be treated with dignity and to live without fear. There is no excuse—not culture, not tradition—for this kind of hate and inhumanity. https://t.co/g208NzeS7l
Joe Biden tweeted: .@NRA opposition to a full reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act is sickening. We must do more to protect victims of stalking and abuse. It makes no sense to allow those who perpetrated the abuse to have access to deadly firearms. We must stand up now for survivors.
Joe Biden tweeted: Whether on the assembly line, at the grocery store checkout, or in the boardroom, every woman deserves to make every penny a man doing the same job makes. The #PaycheckFairnessAct will help us get there. Congratulations @rosadelauro and thank you for your leadership on this.

Joe Biden tweeted: Silence is complicity. Our children are listening. The time to speak out is now.
Joe Biden tweeted: On behalf of Jill, myself, and all of the Bidens, our hearts go out to the community in Christchurch suffering from today’s senseless violence. Friday prayers for those who were gathered at their mosques has seen families torn apart by hate.
Joe Biden tweeted: No one should live in fear of being fired, evicted from their home, or denied service in a restaurant just because of their gender identity or who they love. The #EqualityAct is long overdue, and will ensure LGBTQ Americans are treated with the dignity and respect they deserve.

Joe Biden tweeted: Foreign election interference is not only a serious threat to our democratic institutions, it’s a threat to our national security. Russia and other authoritarian regimes are actively seeking to try to change outcomes of our democratic elections, and we can’t allow that to happen. https://t.co/9hFF6sHCQ5
Joe Biden tweeted: Today I congratulated President @IvanDuque on his successful visit to Washington. Maintaining strong bipartisan support for #Colombia is vitally important to meeting key security and economic challenges in the hemisphere, including humanitarian aid for refugees from #Venezuela.
Joe Biden tweeted: Stand with survivors and advocates like @nguyen_amanda, @ZerlinaMaxwell, @ruthmglenn, @DavidsonJess22, @Mariska, and so many others. Reauthorize VAWA now.
Joe Biden tweeted: There is nothing more powerful that Congress can do to help women, strengthen families, and save lives than reauthorizing VAWA. Now.
Joe Biden tweeted: VAWA’s power is that it gets stronger with each reauthorization. This year can be no different. Like was done in 2000 and 2005 and 2013, we must expand the reach of VAWA to respond to the needs of survivors at risk every day.
Joe Biden tweeted: One in five women will still be victims of rape or attempted rape in their lifetimes. On average, three women a day are murdered by their husbands or boyfriends. Nothing is more urgent than reauthorizing and expanding the law that makes women safer.
Joe Biden tweeted: Since the passage of VAWA, annual rates of domestic violence have dropped by 63%. The National Domestic Violence Hotline responds to more than 26,000 people a month, creating a safety net for survivors. We have made progress, but there is much more to do. Right now.
Joe Biden tweeted: When I wrote the Violence Against Women Act in 1994, I believed it would be a lifeline. But this Congress has turned it into a political football. It’s time to pass a strong reauthorization to the Violence Against Women Act. No more stalling. Lives are on the line.
Joe Biden tweeted: I know from personal experience the only way to overcome grief is to find purpose. The Parkland students &amp; families will not allow us to turn away from our responsibilities to those 17 fallen angels. We aren’t there yet, but with their determination &amp; insistence, we’ll get there.
Joe Biden tweeted: One year after the tragic massacre in Parkland, we’ve not done nearly enough to ensure this will never happen again. In the last year far too many have died from gun violence. But I have hope. #MSDStrong
Joe Biden tweeted: Only a tyrant would prevent the delivery of food and medicine to people he claims to lead. The international community must support Juan Guaido and the National Assembly. It is time for Maduro to step aside and allow a democratic transition. The Venezuelan people deserve better.
Joe Biden tweeted: John Dingell was the Dean of the House. He earned that title — not just because he was there the longest — but because he led with great moral courage and vision. He was a friend and I will miss him terribly. Debbie is in my prayers.

Joe Biden tweeted: These new rules would endanger students and make it harder for survivors of sexual assault to seek justice. https://t.co/qEV7z3Ewpx
Joe Biden tweeted: What happened today to @JussieSmollett must never be tolerated in this country. We must stand up and demand that we no longer give this hate safe harbor; that homophobia and racism have no place on our streets or in our hearts. We are with you, Jussie. https://t.co/o8ilPu68CM
Joe Biden tweeted: https://t.co/iYah5x11To
Joe Biden tweeted: An untested rape kit means a survivor without justice. I wrote the first rape kit backlog law because every survivor deserves closure, and because evidence shows testing kits can identify men who have committed multiple rapes - and might again. Test every kit. Every single one.

Joe Biden tweeted: It is clear this administration has abandoned those core American beliefs. Secretary Mattis’ presence and his voice of reason and experience will be missed in the Pentagon and the Situation Room.
Joe Biden tweeted: I’ve had disagreements with Secretary Mattis, but we shared the view — long-held by Democrats and Republicans in this nation — that respect for our allies and a commitment to the most important and effective alliances in history made America safer.
