This matters to many families with loved ones who have diabetes and rely on insulin to survive.\\nToday is a good day. https://t.co/wOFfv6RUwX\\nToday, I signed the Respect for Marriage Act into law. \\n\\nWe are reaffirming a fundamental truth: Love is love, and Americans should have the right to marry the person they love.\\nSome welcome news on the economic front. https://t.co/xii4FwC4Hf\\nThe Respect for Marriage Act will safeguard the rights and protections to which LGBTQ+ and interracial couples and their children are entitled. \\n\\nIt will also ensure that LGBTQ+ youth will grow up knowing that they can lead full, happy lives and build families of their own. https://t.co/pa9xQbNMKJ\\nFor the first time since 1934, every single senator in a sitting president's party won reelection in a midterm—plus, Pennsylvania elected @JohnFetterman.\\n\\nLooking forward to working together to deliver for the American people in the new year. https://t.co/mlZtXeDwJi\\nThe “Butch-Lewis Act” in the American Rescue Plan allowed us to cover over 1,000 employers and 350,000 union workers and retirees facing benefit cuts of up to 60% starting in the next few years if we hadn’t acted.\\nThe American Rescue Plan helped keep multi-employer pension plans for union workers and retirees solvent for decades to come. \\n\\nThis week, we announced our plan to prevent drastic cuts to workers’ hard-earned pension benefits that were scheduled to occur in the next few years.\\nBy including the “Butch-Lewis Act” in the American Rescue Plan, we shored up the pension plans for millions of union workers.
